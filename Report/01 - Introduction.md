# Data Science Toolbox - Assessment 05

*This project is the 5th assessment for the Data Science Toolbox from the MSc Mathematics of Cybersecurity course at the University of Bristol (2020/21). There are 3 contributors to the project. While it is preferrable to be able to test models and draw solid conclusions, the most important parts of these assessments is to explore options available for good Data Science in the industry and learn new skills throughout the project.*

## Introduction

In this assessment our group was tasked to apply Massively parallel Data Science technology in a cyber-security context. Similar to the previous assessment. In this assessment we decided to build on the work previously done in Assessment 3 which can be found [here](https://github.com/xiaozhang-github/DST-Assessment-3), which was on topic modelling.

We wanted to see if we could achieve a speed up in learning process using parallel processing, and further exploring what solutions were available online for conducting further topic modelling in this manner.

We decided we wanted to try and implement various different available packages available, primarily being used around the parallel processing package PySpark. These included:

* Word Scraping
* SparkNLP package
* Spark's native mllib package

A major learning process and aim of the project was to be able to successfully install and implement PySpark for use in Python. Mostly using Windows machines, we struggled to set up a working Spark environment for a while but eventually managed to get Spark running on at least a few of our machines, though we did still experience the occasional error.
