    "## Attempted implementation of the Spark mllib package\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the example from [the documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-clustering.html) using our data generated in [this file](https://github.com/Galeforse/DST-Assessment-05/blob/main/Gabriel%20Grant/rdd%20lda%20test.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "We tried to form data that was similar to that used in examples using the following packages, however due to a lack of understanding of the intricacies of how the package worked and an overall lack of documentation, with only very simple examples. Therefore while we could convert our data to be used by this package after many failed attempts at trying to get something working and extensive web research of the problem, we still ended up not finding any particularly useful results.\n",
    "\n",
    "It was hard to implement this on our data without a wide variety of examples to cross reference with. I managed to convert the data to look like the data found in the examples however, in doing so the data seemed to lose meaning and also didn't seem to use any form of dictionary and therefore the topics seemed to be practically random with no relevance between any of the top terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "The previously linked file also contains attempts at another similar implementation of LDA using data formatted as RDDs, however once again converting our data from the very familiar Pandas dataframe to the far more confusing and unknown spark.DataFrame format. However this package would not work with data unless it was in the correct format that it wanted for processing. I tried re-running the pipeline that was used in a previous part of the report to filter and lemmatize the data and see if this process would allow us more suitable results however the amount of investment required to get this to work weighed up against the fact we had already managed to get SparkNLP running both well, and doing a very similar job to what we would be attempting here it didn't seem worth persuing this any further with the time we had available."

    "I'm confused as to how this package exactly works, it doesn't seem to learn LDA in a typical way; there is no use of dictionaries and therefore the topic clustering seems to be random and therefore not particularly interesting to draw conclusions from. This is mostly due to the fact we had to convert the data to vectorised counts to be used with the package; the package would not work with strings, constantly throwing errors, however without a link to the strings they represent it makes sense that there is no cohesion amongst the results. The examples used purely numerical data and when searching for further examples that used text, it was hard to find examples in Python, and most Python examples instead reccomended the use of the SparkNLP package."

This advice will help you avoid scams and help you with next steps if you have been unlucky enough to fall victim to cyber crime. \\\\nTo help online shoppers we have also been running a social media campaign which uses the 8 tips in our online shopping guidance. The campaign will help customers to focus on three important areas: preparing to shop, while you are shopping and after you’ve shopped.   \\\\nSo, before you go hunting the best deals take time to look at the guidance and connect with our social media platforms to ensure you are prepared for all the madness of Black Friday and Cyber Monday:\\\\nTwitter (@NCSC)\\\\nInstagram (@cyberhq)\\\\nLinkedIn (National Cyber Security Centre)', 'Over a million T-Mobile customers have been affected following a data breach conducted by a cyber criminal.\\\\nThe telecoms company confirmed last weekend that the malicious actor had obtained personal data, although financial data and passwords were not stolen.\\\\nIn it’s disclosure notice, T-Mobile confirmed it had discovered and shut down the unauthorised access and had reported the incident to authorities. \\\\nEven if passwords or financial data have not been stolen, it is still possible for criminals to use personal data steal identities and gain access to accounts.
