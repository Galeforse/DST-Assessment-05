In addition, German social media site Knuddels, was fined €20k by German regulators following a data breach. \n \nIn one week, a number of new breaches have also been disclosed, such as the personal data of 500 million Marriott/Westin Hotels customers and the personal data of 100 million Quora users. \nThe volume of data breaches in recent months has been significant so it remains important that individuals and businesses remain vigilant to the threat of breaches.  \n \nThe potential impact on individuals who have had their personal information stolen must not be underestimated. The threat of personal information theft is almost certain to remain and companies that store these details must ensure it is protected against any potential intrusion, for the benefit of their customers and their own reputation.  \nDesigners, developers and operators of online services can find guidance on how to make services harder to compromise here on the NCSC website. \nWe would also recommend reading our guidance around the phishing threat following data breaches as well as how to protect bulk data.\n\nYouTuber fan promotes subscription via printer hack\nThis week an anonymous individual hacked 50,000 printers, causing them to print out a message that urged people to subscribe to the PewDiePie YouTube channel. PewDiePie was battling with a rival for subscribers in order to retain its status as the most subscribed channel on YouTube. \nThe printer hacker said they had identified 800,000 printers with open security settings and selected 50,000 to print out support for PewDiePie. The hacker reportedly used a tool called the Printer Exploitation Toolkit (or PRET) to send automated scripts to printers that had IPP (Internet Printing Protocol) ports, LPD (Line Printer Daemon) ports, and port 9100 left open over the Internet.  \nThe connections between your networks and the Internet and/or other partner networks, can expose your systems and technologies to attack. By creating and implementing some simple policies and appropriate architectural and technical responses, organisations can reduce the chances of these attacks succeeding.\nThe NCSC recommends that organisations do not expose printers on their networks without setting up authentications. More generally, the NCSC recommends that users secure devices by changing default passwords and regularly patching.\n--\n  The ECSEPA Cyber Security Evidence Study\nThe Evaluating Cyber Security Evidence for Policy Advice (ECSEPA) project, funded by EPSRC and supported by the Sociotechnical Security Group at the NCSC, is aiming to learn more about how the UK government cyber security advisory and policy-making community evaluate evidence in their roles.

The malware they often try to deliver to your computers and devices is constantly being upgraded and improved, however the actual content and structure of the phishing email does not evolve much.\nCyber criminals will send an email that looks to be from someone you know, or is familiar to you, such as a high street brand or bank. Within the email, there may be an attachment or link for you to click. This is when most phishing emails strike. The link or attachment will be loaded with malicious code, which when clicked, will then download malware to your device and infect you.  \nThere’s nothing to be ashamed about being tricked into clicking on a phishing email. It happens. When our very own Dr Ian Levy was targeted by a prankster, he nearly fell for the bait. They are tricky to identify, and they often employ emotive tactics to get you to drop your guard and click on the bait. \nOften the attachment will be disguised as a genuine Word document but will have malicious malware embedded inside. A recent phishing campaign has been identified, that was trying to infect users with TrickBot - a piece of malware used by cyber criminals to access online accounts, in order to steal log in credentials to facilitate identity fraud. Potential victims were sent an email purporting to be from a UK high street bank, the email address used looks very close to what one might think it could be. Once the email is opened, there is a letter attachment which when clicked on, runs a malicious macro downloading TrickBot and installing it.  \nThe NCSC has previously blogged about phishing, offering advice on how to train yourself and your staff in how to spot phishing emails.  \nThe NCSC has also published phishing guidance aimed at organisations. Technical controls such as keeping your devices up to date and using anti-malware software can also be effective in reducing the impact of a phishing attack such as TrickBot. Organisations should refer to our End User Devices and Office Macro guidance for further advice. \n\nMalicious scripts make websites malicious\nMalicious scripts are pieces of code which can be injected into a website or browser by a nefarious actor to steal sensitive information.  \nAnother company recently admitted to suffering a data breach, with a fake Google script being the apparent cause. Almost 10,000 people had their personal data compromised with 6,600 having financial data, including CVV number (sometimes called security code, which is found on the back of your card) compromised. \nThe most recent breach comes after a number of high profile data breaches this year, such as British Airways and Newegg, in which malicious scripts were used on websites or cloud servers to compromise customer data. \nIn the run up to Black Friday and the Christmas trading period, companies should ensure that their websites are secure and individuals should ensure that they do not send personal or financial information on illegitimate websites. \nThe NCSC recommends that all online services undergo regular security reviews – including pentests – and public sector websites can benefit from the NCSC Web Check configuration and vulnerability scanning service.\nThe NCSC has also published seven tips for staying safe online before, during and after bagging Black Friday bargains.

119,119,16th November 2018,"['Smishing, the criminal’s data source in your pocket\nAccording to recent reports, smishing, a technique similar to phishing, but using an SMS message rather than an email, is on the rise. The SMS message, which can be disguised to appear from an official source, will have a link which can download malware or redirect the victim to a malicious website to steal credentials or other personal data. \nAs smartphones become more popular, and the use of email declines, criminals are turning to smishing to spread malware. A UK bank recently suffered IT issues which resulted in cyber criminals taking advantage of the situation by sending SMS messages purporting to be the bank but containing malicious links to malware. \nSecurity reports suggest that the use of smishing poses greater security concerns as phones can hold more information about individuals than a PC. Furthermore the reports state that, as people believe smartphones are less susceptible to malware than PCs, they may not have the relevant security systems installed, including antivirus which is standard in all PCs. \nThe NCSC has published advice on how to protect your device from malware.\n  Popular GDPR-related plugin compromised\nAccording to media reporting, cyber criminals have recently found and exploited a vulnerability in the popular WordPress plugin WP GDPR Compliance. The vulnerability allowed the malicious actors to access WordPress sites and install backdoor scripts. \nThe vulnerability has now been patched, but according to reports, there are still many WordPress based sites using the non-patched version. \nThe motivation behind this compromise is not yet clear, but it is likely the hackers intended to use the backdoor as a means of harvesting user credentials which they could monetise at a later date. \nIf you have a WordPress site, ensure that it is patched by downloading the latest version.\n  African ISP inadvertently routes internet traffic via Russia and China\nOn Monday afternoon there was a widely reported outage of Google services in the US. This lasted for 74 minutes and was due to internet traffic being wrongly directed via Russia and China in a situation known as a “BGP Hijack”.\nThe issue has been linked to the West African Internet Service Provider (ISP) Main One. They announced the issue was down to a misconfiguration error that “leaked” and caused internet traffic to be redirected.  \nInitial concerns that the attack was malicious in nature were luckily unfounded; although the incident has again raised issues surrounding the vulnerabilities of the Border Gateway Protocol – a legacy, trust-based protocol, responsible for the deciding how traffic is routed across the internet.\n ']","['Cyber attack', 'Cyber threat', 'Vulnerabilities']",https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-16th-november-2018
120,120,9th November 2018,"['Growth in cryptocurrency scams\nNumerous cryptocurrency scams have emerged since the rising price of some currencies, notably Bitcoin and Ethereum, made them highly lucrative. \nThese scams have become increasingly common over recent months, but the methods behind them are not new. Some scammers pretend to be holding large sums of money that they will ‘giveaway’ once the victim has sent them a smaller amount of currency. Others offer large amounts of a new cryptocurrency in exchange for a small amount of an established one. \nScams involving Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs), through which the public are invited to invest in a new currency, are particularly popular amongst criminal groups. In 2018, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed at least 12 separate cases against organisations that had set up allegedly fraudulent ICOs, with tens of millions in purported profits. This week, the BBC reported that scammers accessed Twitter accounts for high profile brands had been hijacked by fraudsters and used to promote fake giveaways of cryptocurrency. \n  Third-party JavaScript abused to steal money from Cryptocurrency exchange users\nResearchers at cyber security company ESET discovered that a website analytics platform was compromised in early November. Attackers were able to modify a JavaScript plugin used by websites to track visitor statistics.  \nAlthough this allowed a malicious script to be injected into all websites that use the plugin, the attackers only targeted a specific Cryptocurrency exchange. The plugin was modified to include a component that checked for a specific identifier for the exchange’s withdrawal page. If detected, a second script replaced the victim’s intended destination Bitcoin addresses with one used by the attackers.  \nWhile the total losses from this attack are unknown, the incident highlights the risks associated with using third party scripts on pages where financial data is input, transactions are made, or other sensitive data is processed. Malicious injection of JavaScript via third-party code has also been used to harvest payment card data from online checkout pages through a technique widely referred to as “MageCart”.  \nWith the approach of Christmas, cyber criminals are likely to￼ ￼capitalise on increased levels of expenditure and financial transfers made online. This technique will almost certainly remain a viable way of doing so.\u202fThe NCSC has previously published guidance for website owners and third-party developers in relation to attacks using JavaScript modification. \n ']","['Cyber attack', 'Cyber threat', 'Vulnerabilities']",https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-9th-november-2018

Sensitive PII extended as far back as 2014 and included name, date of birth, email, address, driver licence, health history and insurance policy details. \nFollowing the compromise, hackers used the same account to send out emails of their own. The content of the emails has not been revealed but they were likely attempted spear-phishing attacks on members.  \nAccording to the UK’s Charity Digital News, the number of reports of data breaches among charities has doubled over the last two years with education and childcare organisations reporting a 142% increase.  \nFraudsters can use children’s details to make financial applications and create a credit history for the child whose identity they’ve stolen. Children typically do not have credit records, so it is likely that any activity surrounding the identity theft will remain undetected for a long time.  \nNCSC’s Cyber security: Small Charity Guide provides small charities with cost-effective measures to improve security across their IT estate and to achieve GDPR compliance.\n\nGandCrab\nVictims of an aggressive ransomware known as GandCrab can now find assistance in recovering their files from Europol’s No More Ransom website. \nDeveloped by police in Romania, Bulgaria, France, Italy, Poland, the Netherlands, United Kingdom, United States and individual security companies, the comprehensive decryption tool is able to recover files from all versions of GandCrab apart from v1.4 and v5.  \nGandCrab is a relatively new piece of malware, discovered back in January 2018, and is largely considered to be ransomware-as-a-service (RaaS).

Previously in 2015 a former Morrisons employee had been convicted of leaking employee payroll records. \nThe case reinforces the importance of safeguarding data within an organisation, not only from external threats but also insiders. The insider threat refers to employees who either deliberately or accidentally pose a threat to the confidentiality, integrity or availability of an organisation’s data. The outcome has significant implications for all data controllers and data processors.\nA good start for any organisation keen on safeguaring their data would be to read the NCSC's 10 Steps to Cyber Security.\n  Remote access trojan developer convicted\nA Remote Access Trojan (RAT) developer from the US has been sentenced to 30 months in prison for creating and selling a RAT known as LuminosityLink. A RAT is a programme, which once installed on a victim’s machine, allows remote administrative control. In a malicious context it can, among many other functions, be used to install backdoors and key loggers, take screenshots, and exfiltrate data. \nAccording to the US Department of Justice more than 6,000 customer had purchased this trojan, and its use in criminal or espionage activity has been widely documented.\nThe NCSC has previously highlighted the threat from publicly available hacking tools available for sale online, including commercial software packages which could potentially be used for malicious purposes. Although some of these are legitimate penetration testing or administration tools, many are being used by hackers to facilitate malicious activity.  \nThe availability of these hacking tools provides threat actors of varying capabilities the opportunity to compromise information and establish persistence on a target network. Their relatively wide uptake and use make defending networks and attributing incidents more challenging. \nThe NCSC has recently published advice on limiting the effectiveness of hacking tools, as well as detecting their use in a network environment.\n  Further details on TRITON malware attack\nA recent report by FireEye has provided further details about the intrusion activity leading to the deployment of the TRITON attack framework, which caused a Saudi petrochemical plant to go into safe shutdown in 2017.\nThe NCSC believes this was a highly targeted attack, and there is no credible evidence that the UK has been affected directly by this malware. The incident demonstrates how the global cyber threat continues to increase and change; ensuring the CNI is protected against possible risks is a vital part of keeping the UK secure. \nThe NCSC has previously issued advice to Industrial Control System operators via CISP and in a public advisory on the website, recommending a range of detection and mitigation activities.""]","['Cyber threat', 'Cyber attack', 'Vulnerabilities']",https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-26th-october-2018

Default passwords such as ‘password’ or ‘default’ will be deemed weak and in breach of the state law. This could then open the manufacturer up for prosecution should the user become the victim of cyber crime because of weak security on the device.\nThis positive step will encourage the manufacture of products with greater cyber security that will roll out to wider global markets.\nInternet of Things (IoT)-related cyber crime is well documented, with the Mirai and Owari botnets widely reported. In March 2018, DCMS (The Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport) and the NCSC published a report on Secure by Design, and called for industry, academic institutions and civil society to contribute to the proposed interventions. The report identifies two main risks associated with insecure IoT devices:\nconsumer security, privacy and safety may be undermined by the vulnerability of individual devices; and\nthe wider economy faces an increasing threat of large-scale cyber attacks launched from large volumes of insecure IoT devices.\nThe NCSC and DCMS will be publishing the Secure by Design Code of Practice, in addition to consumer guidance on IoT devices, in the coming weeks.\nGoogle+ and Project Strobe\nOn 8 October, Google announced the existence of Project Strobe – a comprehensive review of third-party developer access to Google account and Android device data, and their philosophy around apps’ access to data.\nAs part of that announcement they disclosed that in March 2018 they had identified and immediately patched a bug in the Google+ platform. That bug potentially exposed customer data including “name, nickname, email address, occupation, gender, relationship status, birthday and age”. Google’s analysis identified that in the two weeks prior to the bug’s fix, the profiles of up to 500,000 accounts were potentially affected. Google found no evidence that any developer abused the bug, nor evidence that any profile data was misused. However, for privacy reasons Google only retain two week’s log data, so they were unable to rule out misuse prior to this period.\nGoogle has decided to shut down the Google+ service in August 2019, due to lack of use and the difficulty of maintaining the service.\nFor any user of social media, this breach is a reminder that social media applications that you no longer use may still contain your data and this could potentially be leaked.\nIt is recommended that any active or inactive users of social media platforms review their data held by such platforms to limit any future exposure to breaches.

124,124,5th October 2018,"[""Microsoft Warns Fileless Malware on the Rise\nMedia reporting has highlighted a recent warning from Microsoft that so-called ‘fileless’ malware attacks are on the rise.\nAccording to the report, the trend towards fileless malware is being driven by the increasing effectiveness of antivirus solutions, which can detect the installation of malicious files on a hard-drive.\nBy contrast, traditional anti-malware products find fileless malware significantly more difficult to detect. This is because the malicious payload is not written to the hard-drive and is instead run directly in the system’s memory.\nFileless malware can use the default tools present on a computer, such as Powershell, to achieve malicious effects, a tactic known as ‘living-off-the-land'.\nWhilst fileless malware is nothing new, knowledge of how to implement it is becoming more widespread. This has been accelerated by an increase in the number of tools that assist in the creation of fileless malware. The use of fileless malware and other more sophisticated techniques will become increasingly prevalent as malicious actors find new ways of circumventing security controls.\nThe simplest way to avoid this type of threat is to disable tools such as Powershell and Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI).\nAttribution of Russian close access and remote cyber operations\nDutch and UK authorities attributed a range of malicious cyber activity to Russian military intelligence (GRU) on Thursday 4 October.\nOne operation was a close access operation against the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in the Hague. Unlike most malicious cyber operations which are conducted remotely, this required physical proximity to the targeted system. In this case the attackers used equipment to attempt to gain access to the OPCW’s Wi-Fi network. Other close access operations require hands-on access to a target’s devices.\nSeveral other operations involved the use of spear-phishing, in which the attacker crafts an email targeted at a specific individual, aiming to make them click on a malicious link or open a malicious attachment.\nIn response to Thursday’s attributions, NCSC has also published a technical advisory on indicators of compromise for malware used by APT28.\nNCSC has also published advice on avoiding phishing attacks and securing end user devices.\nLoJax – A new type of rootkit\nSecurity researchers at anti-virus software company ESET have revealed a new type of malware that is capable of surviving reinstallation of the Windows operating system or even hard drive replacement.\nThis type of clandestine rootkit is designed to provide continued privileged access to a computer while actively hiding its presence. This is the first time this type of malware has been seen ‘in the wild’.\nThe malware dubbed “LoJax” makes use of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) which enables the connection of a computer’s firmware to its operating system and is largely replacing the Basic Input Output System (BIOS). Like BIOS, UEFI is installed at the time of manufacture and is the first program that runs when a computer is turned on. This enables LoJax to start every time the computer is booted.\nThe malware is based on an older version of a legitimate application called LoJack and/or Computrace, which enables stolen devices to be found. The code is hidden within the UEFI firmware and when started, connects to a command and control server over the internet.\nThe researchers have attributed LoJax to the threat group Sednit/Fancy Bear/APT28.\nRemoving the malware from an infected device involves updating (or re-flashing) the UEFI firmware, an operation not commonly done and certainly not by the typical user.\nInfection prevention is easier than a cure. PCs with Windows 8 and 10 are shipped with a feature called “Secure Boot” enabled which is designed to prevent digitally unsigned software from hijacking the boot process and concealing itself from the operating system.\nNCSC provides detailed guidance on the management of UEFI firmware settings which will almost certainly prevent this type of malware attack.""]",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-5th-october-2018

The service enabled cyber criminals to test their malware against antivirus software, especially those used by the US retail sector, but also global government and financial institutions.\nOperating from 2009 to 2016, Scan4you is believed to have assisted with the theft of over $15 billion. The service was reportedly used by the cyber criminals behind the Citadel malware, responsible for infecting over 11 million computers and attributed with $500 million in fraud losses.\nLaw enforcement worldwide are tackling the enablers of cyber crime who sell their services to aid online criminals.

The UK was found to be the sixth most targeted country for this type of attack.\nBotnets will use breached credentials to attempt to logon to another website. Consequently, one of the most effective ways of managing these credential stuffing botnets is the 'low and slow' method, which sees attackers attempt to camouflage their attack amongst legitimate traffic whilst limiting the number of attempts made. The more attempts made, the more valid login credentials will be identified. However, the botnets need to be carefully managed to ensure victims do not notice this activity, possibly mistaking them for a DDoS attack due to the high volumes of traffic they generate.\nIt is worth noting that not every attack tried to be discreet. This could be because of the (lack of) skill of the botnet operator or that it is actually designed to DDoS the victim. For example, one organisation that saw 7 million legitimate logins over six days also saw over 8½ million malicious login ateempts over the same period.\nNote: Credential stuffing is the technique of using compromised credentials (i.e. usernames and passwords) to try and access other websites. This technique can be successful when people reuse the same password across a number of different websites.\nThe NCSC has published guidance on how to protect against a password guessing attack alongside password strategies to help an organisation stay secure. Guidance on multi-factor authentication (MFA) or two-factor authentication (2FA) is also available.\nDon’t yank my chain – the cyber threat to software supply chains\nThe continuing threat to the software supply chain is again in the spotlight following a new report by threat intelligence company Crowdstrike.\nThe NCSC defines the supply chain threat as “operations or activities that are designed to threaten the confidentiality, integrity or availability of communications, data or systems: and which use any part of the supply chain as an attack vector.”\nA survey of senior IT Professionals by Crowdstrike[i] has emphasised the ongoing scale of the problem: two-thirds of respondents reported that their organisation had been subject to a software supply chain attack. Given the often under-reported nature of cyber attacks, this is likely to have been an underestimate.\nAwareness of the cyber threat generally by organisations, combined with continual investment and development of network defences, has meant that cyber actors will seek alternative ways of attacking organisations. The supply chain can sometimes be the weak link in cyber defence.\nAnother study of UK businesses by telecoms firm Beaming also highlights that attitudes to lax security procedures from suppliers can affect their ability to do further business. According to the study, a third of UK firms would stop using a supplier whose negligence caused a cyber security incident.[ii]\nThe findings in both these reports emphasise that supply chain attacks are not a threat that will go away, but will likely increase. They offer further evidence that good cyber security is essential not just for organisations but for their suppliers as well. Cyber security is a collective, all-round endeavour and these reports firmly underline that point.\nNCSC has published a range of guidance on supply chain security which can be found here:\n/guidance/a4-supply-chain\n/guidance/supply-chain-security\n/guidance/assessing-supply-chain-security\n\n[i] https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/global-survey-reveals-supply-chain-as-a-rising-and-critical-new-threat-vector/\n[ii] https://www.beaming.co.uk/press-releases/a-third-of-businesses-would-sack-suppliers-that-neglected-cyber-security/""]",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-28th-september-2018

In a recent report from Cofense, it was noted that the exploitation of Microsoft Office macros comprised 45% of all deliveries. A separate report showed that a further 37% exploited the Microsoft Office Memory Corruption Vulnerability (CVE-2017-11882).\nMacros can be easily developed and distributed. Despite Microsoft having disabled macros by default, it only takes minimal user interaction to start the infection chain. Subsequently, the victim could be infected by a range of malware, with Geodo, GandCrab and Trickbot among the variants observed.\nAs Cofense noted, the range of observed payloads indicates that this delivery mechanism is used widely across the cyber crime landscape by both “mature and amateur operators alike.”\nThe NCSC website has published guidance on Macro security for Microsoft Office. It also has guidance on phishing.\n\nCyber threat to university networks\nThe University of Edinburgh was a victim of a Denial of Service attack, which happened on the first day of freshers’ week. It affected the university’s websites, online services and Wi-Fi networks. Following the attack, the website of Jisc, who provide digital solutions to UK education and research organisations, featured a blog post which explored how and when Denial of Service attacks impact universities.\nThe post observed that Denial of Service attacks were most frequent between 0800 and 1500, and dramatically less frequent during university holidays. The author noted that the timing could be indicative that staff and students were the key initiators of the attacks, while recognising that there was little benefit in disrupting an organisation during its quietest periods.\nThe annual slow-down in attacks, which occurs as universities enter their summer break began earlier this year. The author noted that this may have been due to law enforcement activity.\nIn April, the National Crime Agency (NCA) and Dutch partners took down webstresser.org as part of Operation Power OFF. The website had been a leading provider of Denial of Service attacks, with upwards of 4 million attacks being orchestrated through the site, for fees as low as £11.\nWhile disruptive attacks cause the most visible difficulties for staff and students, intrusion and theft by state-sponsored groups and cyber criminals remain key threats to the sector.\nIn August, Dell Secureworks reported on a global campaign which targeted 76 universities in 14 countries. The campaign saw victims directed to spoofed versions of their university’s website, where their credentials could be stolen. Stolen credentials can enable theft of sensitive information, can be used to influence or deceive others, and are themselves a saleable commodity. The report attributed the campaign to a state-sponsored Iranian group.\nThe NCSC has previously published guidance to help organisations understand and mitigate against DoS attacks.\n\nGDPR three months in\nThe Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) recently provided the first update on the impact of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) since it went live three months ago.\nOver this period, the ICO, who are the regulator under GDPR, received an average of 500 calls a week to their breach reporting line. Collected data has identified some important trends concerning the reporting of relevant incidents. The key lesson is that organisations need to get their incident reporting plans in place and to ensure that:\nBreaches are reported within the appropriate time period. Breaches are to be reported within 72 working hours of the organisation becoming aware of the incident.\nBreach reports are as complete as possible before reporting, where details are missing a rough timeline of when the ICO can expect further information should be provided.\nThe person reporting the breach is authorised to discuss the problem in the required detail.\nOf the cyber incidents that were reported, nearly half were the result of phishing. Malware (10%) and ransomware (6%) were also other notable causes of breaches reported.\nThe NCSC, in collaboration with the ICO, has published guidance on GDPR Security Outcomes.\nBristol Airport cyber attack\nBristol Airport reported last week that it had been the victim of a cyber attack resulting in flight display screens failing. Whilst there was no reported disruption to flight departures or arrivals, flight details including check-in desks, boarding gates and flight times had to be provided via the public address system and displayed on white boards. The outage continued over two days before normal service could resume. A statement from Bristol Airport explained that the systems were taken offline by their own security administrators in order to mitigate a suspected online criminal attack and prevent any damage.\nSome reports indicate that this was a ransomware attack. Ransomware comes in different forms. However, in its basic form, a payment is demanded to decrypt files or unlock a machine infected by the malware. There is no guarantee that once a payment has been made that the victim will have access restored to them.\nThe NCSC has published guidance on ransomware and handling an incident.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-21st-september-2018
127,127,7th September 2018,"[""Owari botnet own-goal takeover\nSecurity researchers recently took over the large Owari botnet after its owner failed to change the command-and-control (C&C) server’s weak default credentials.\nOwari is a Mirai botnet variant, designed to exploit Internet of Things (IoT) devices with weak or default passwords. Following the publication of Mirai’s source code numerous variants have been observed, often competing against each other.\nOwari scans for known vulnerabilities found not just in IoT devices but in a wide range of networked devices. It infects vulnerable devices to integrate them within the botnet. Owari makes money by offering web stressing/DDoS as a service to customers via the dark web. It was also designed to search for and remove other malware already on a device. The researchers were able to analyse how Owari operates and found information on historical DDoS attacks carried out against various targets some of which were associated with rival IoT botnets.\nDespite researchers gaining access to Owari’s C&C server, it will almost certainly make little difference as according to researchers most C&C botnet servers are throwaway by design, with a shelf life of about one week. Owari will probably simply appear elsewhere on the internet.\nIt is ironic that a malware system designed to compromise systems with weak security credentials is protected with weak credentials itself.\nIt is highly likely that malware developers will continue to use Mirai variants similar to Owari as a mechanism to quickly develop botnets capable of delivering DDoS attacks, data theft or into swarms of malware proxies and cryptominers.\nThe NCSC is working with DCMS to establish a code of practice for IoT security. You can read more about that in a recent blog.\nConsumers can reduce the chances of their IoT devices being affected by Mirai-like threats by ensuring they’re using the latest software on their IoT devices and use good passwords.\nFraudsters exploiting newsworthy events\nOpportunistic fraudsters have been using current events and exploiting public concern for their own financial gain.\nExamples include:\nThe recent IT system problems reported by UK bank TSB led to a rise in phishing and text message scams claiming to be from the bank. These fake text messages and phishing emails often contain malicious links which direct customers straight to the scammers.\nThe 2018 FIFA World Cup taking place in Russia in June/July has led to a rise in phishing scams. Scammers are exploiting the willingness of football fans to pay inflated ticket prices with fake websites being set up to lure victims. Fans buying tickets from these sources run the risk of receiving fake tickets or none at all. Even more concerning, the fraudsters will acquire payment details, leaving fans exposed to further potential online fraud.\nFake World Cup-associated websites have also been set up offering accommodation, flights and 'official' hospitality at stadiums. Phishing emails have been sent advising users that they have won a World Cup Lottery and to send details and a small cash sum to claim their 'prize'. The NCSC recently published a blog outlining how fans can best secure devices and key accounts\nBritish Airways data breach\nBritish Airways (BA) have reported that it suffered a data breach that compromised names, email addresses and credit card information. BA suspect the breach was a result of criminal activity, and have notified the police and relevant authorities.\nThe NCSC is working with partners to better understand this incident and how it has affected customers, and have published a statement. It has been reported that up to 380,000 customers could have been affected. The incident is thought to have affected some customers who made bookings on the BA website or app between August 21 and September 5, 2018. BA have reported that the compromised data includes names, email addresses and credit card information. You can read BA’s latest information here.\nThe NCSC has published guidance for customers who think they may have been affected, and anybody who receives suspicious phone calls, emails or text messages should report them to Action Fraud.\nMobile spyware hacks and breaches\nMedia sources have reported multiple hacks and a data breach affecting businesses that offer mobile spyware as a service. In the last week TheTruthSpy, Family Orbit and mSpy have all been compromised. The NCSC previously reported on a similar data breach of the TeenSafe app back in May.\nMobile spyware is software that is used to monitor mobile phone use, activity and the location of individuals. It is often used by parents to check on their children; it has also been used by individuals wanting to spy on their current, or former partners and spouses.\nThe information exposed consisted of account information from those using and paying for the service, as well as the information collected from those individuals being monitored. Mobile spyware apps generally collect similar types of data from the subjects they monitor, often consisting of: call logs, SMS, messages sent by third party apps and services, real time location details and history, photographs stored on the mobile device and audio call recordings. This means a significant amount of personal and sensitive data has been exposed, and could potentially be used for blackmail or criminal activity.\nUsers of these compromised mobile spyware services should also remain vigilant for any strange activity on bank accounts or credit cards and take measures to protect the users of the devices they may have installed the software on. If you have used the same password for any other accounts, you should change this immediately. Often attackers know that many individuals re-use passwords and so will try to use stolen credentials on multiple sites hoping it will work.\nTo ensure that no one can access your mobile device without your permission, you should make use of your device’s security features such as pin protection, passwords or a biometric lock. The NCSC has published guidance on keeping mobile devices safe.\n\nDomain abandonment and hijacking\nGabor Szathmari, an independent Australian cyber security researcher has published a blog highlighting the dangers of allowing corporate domain names to expire. Known as domain name abandonment, companies that have merged, been acquired, changed name or gone out of business will often abandon their domain name which is then available for anyone to re-register from domain registrars. Domain name abandonment allows threat actors to gain access to, or reset passwords for online services and profession-specific portals.\nIn his blog, the researcher purchased six domain names formerly belonging to several Australian law firms. Once the domains were re-registered, all email accounts linked to the domain were configured to forward email to one account controlled by the researcher. The new domain owner then simply sat back and watched emails arrive (25,000 in total).\nThe researcher used an online service to search for expired domain names linked to Australian law firms (a similar search for expired .co.uk domains containing the word “solicitors” revealed over 4,000 recently expired domains).\nThe researcher revealed several redacted screenshots of emails showing an abundance of personal details, such as bank statements, supplier invoices, court proceeding transcripts, divorce settlement negotiations and mobile phone billing information. All obtained from simple passive monitoring over three months.\nIn addition to this, he researched email addresses previously associated with the domains using data breach notification websites. The researcher was then able to identify multiple email addresses belonging to legal professionals and staff and was able to use the domain to register on the breach site to reveal leaked passwords previously associated with the email addresses. He was then able to prove that “legal professionals are guilty of using weak passwords on online services and tend to reuse them across multiple websites”.\nUsing just valid emails found on the data breach sites, the researcher was able to prove that he could have performed password resets on social network sites, LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. He could also have reset the password on file storage site Dropbox. The researcher was able to log into profession-specific web portals – The Australian Commonwealth Courts as well as State, District and Local courts. Finally, the researcher was able to log into the LEAP Practice Management Platform which is commonly used software (in the UK and Australia) for managing legal practices including client files, legal documents, trust accounting and billing. Had he wished, the researcher could have also reset passwords on Paypal and Google. He also attempted to reset passwords on Office 365 but was defeated due to two-factor authentication.\nDomain abandonment does not just affect data security: In October 2017, IBM broke its cloud global load balancer and reverse DNS service for 21 hours when it allowed three of its domains to expire.\nDomain name abandonment/hijacking is not a well-known security risk to cyber security professionals. Many businesses leave themselves exposed to cyber attacks by allowing their former domain names to expire.\nOrganisations can protect themselves against domain hijacking in several ways, including:\nSetting the domain (and previous domains) to auto-renew each year indefinitely\nLocking the domain using a web service to guard against unauthorised domain transfers\nEnsuring all domain name contacts have valid contact information\nClose, change or remove user accounts that were registered with the business email address (e.g. Dropbox, PayPal, LinkedIn, Facebook)\nEnable two-factor authentication (2FA or MFA) where the feature is supported for online services\nUse unique and complex passwords\nThe NCSC has published guidance on multi-factor authentication for organisations.\n\nPrinters need to be secured\nA recent survey of 200 enterprises with over 1,000 employees in the UK, France, Germany and the US by business and IT analyst firm Quocirca revealed that 61% admitted suffering at least one data breach through insecure printers.i Modern multi-function printers come with a host of features to print, copy, fax, scan and e-mail documents, making them, in effect, computers themselves and therefore potentially vulnerable to cyber attack.\nMulti-function printers are vulnerable to four main security weaknesses: printed documents left unclaimed in print trays, images stored on local printer hard drives, unauthorised access to the printer and several network vulnerabilities such as those using the fax functionality. Examples of cyber attacks have included: disabling printers for ransom, accessing insecure printers for vandalismii and pausing print queues while data is extracted.iii Open network ports leave the printer vulnerable to unauthorised remote access which in turn could lead to data theft or their use in denial of service attacks.\nImproperly decommissioned printers have the potential to be exploited for business records still in the printer’s memory.iv\nRecent research also identified 3,800 3D printers that were left exposed online without a security password, leaving them vulnerable to interference. Users had failed to set up this fundamental security precaution through convenience or ignorance meaning hackers could either steal the 3D model plans or alter key parts of the plan to make the printer produce defective items.v\nThe vulnerabilities outlined above show that cyber security for printers should receive as much attention from organisations as other parts of their IT estate when establishing security controls.\nThe NCSC have previously issued guidance on managing network devices.\ntravelling this summer.\nPeople may lower their guard in the context of high-profile or emotionally-engaging events, making these an ideal hook for fraudsters to exploit. You need to be sure that the person reaching out is genuine, and be wary of anyone requesting personal or financial information - banks will never ask for passwords or pin numbers. If it seems too good to be true, it probably is!\nThe NCSC has issued guidance on phishing and how to protect yourself.\nThe ECSEPA Cybersecurity Evidence Study\nThe Evaluating Cyber Security Evidence for Policy Advice (ECSEPA) project survey is intended to learn more about how the UK Government policy advisory and policymaking community evaluate evidence in their roles.\n\nThe objective of the study is to understand how people in your roles can be better supported.

However, allegations have suggested that Facebook may be using the app to identify how users were using other third-party applications, even if the user believed the app was private.\nThe VPN app, which has been downloaded more than 33 million times, has not been removed from Google’s Android store. iOS users who are already using the app can continue to use it but will not receive any further updates. This follows on from Facebook’s March 2018 data breach revelation, when it was reported that 50 million Facebook profiles were harvested by Cambridge Analytica over a number of years and may have been illegally acquired and used.\nThe NCSC’s Cloud Security Principle 1: Data in transit protection advises that data transiting networks should be adequately protected against tampering and eavesdropping.\nThe Get Safe Online website also provides further advice on protecting your Facebook footprint.\nGuidance for Data Breaches\nMore high profile data breaches have come to light recently, affecting the UK’s Superdrug high street store and mobile phone provider T-Mobile.\nIn a statement to customers, Superdrug explained how, on the 20th August 2018, they received a ransom demand believed to be from cyber criminals, claiming they had obtained customer information. Superdrug stated that they could not find any evidence of a data breach but now believe that the cyber criminals accessed their customer accounts using credentials from other websites. Superdrug believed that customer dates of birth, phone numbers and loyalty scheme details were accessed and advised customers to reset their passwords.\nT-Mobile (US) also released a statement explaining how, on 20th August 2018, their cyber security team discovered and isolated an unauthorised access incident. During this incident, customer information such as names, billing addresses, post codes, phone numbers, email addresses, account numbers and type were accessed. There is no indication that any UK based customers were impacted.\nThe NCSC has provided guidance for both victims of data breaches and for businesses storing and holding personal customer information.\n\nVariant of the Mirai botnet returns\nIn 2016, a Mirai botnet DDoS attack crippled the French telecoms provider OVH. Internet access was slowed or prevented for parts of the USA when a service provider, Dyn came under attack. One attack maxed out at 620Gbps, one of the largest the internet has ever witnessed. Mirai worked by enslaving IoT devices.\nNow, the source code of a thought to be abandoned variant of the Mirai botnet has been compiled using an open source tool, Aboriginal Linux, which generates binaries for a considerable number of platforms. This allows it to infect multiple Linux devices, including Android and Debian, which the original Mirai was unable to infect. Infections have been steadily increasing since June, partly due to the lack of patching for IoT devices.\nIoT devices are often unpatched, leaving them vulnerable to infection. Furthermore, resetting the device may clear the malware, but the device will still be liable to infection. As the number of IoT devices continues to grow and security patches are not released, the problem of enslaved devices is likely to get worse and this could result in further large DDoS attacks, limiting services to users.\nIt is important to keep both software and hardware up to date as well as using hardware for which the manufacturer will continue to release patches to minimise vulnerabilities.\nReport on the security of UK Telecommunications by the Parliamentary Office of Science & Technology\nThe Parliamentary Office of Science & Technology (POST) have released a paper on the Security of UK Telecommunications which covers both the physical and cyber threats facing telecommunications networks.\nThe paper expands on POST’s May 2017 paper Cyber Security of UK Infrastructure which identifies the cyber attack threats on critical national infrastructure. The NCSC, along with many other agencies, organisations, individuals and academic institutions have worked with POST on these papers.']",['Cyber attack'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-31st-august-2018
129,129,24th August 2018,"['Home router vulnerabilities exploited for banking credentials\nIn early August, personal and sensitive information was obtained from customers of Brazil’s largest bank after their home routers were ‘hijacked’.\nVictims were unlikely to have been aware of any change resulting from the attack. They selected what appeared to be the correct web page, and were redirected to a convincing fake banking page.\nThis technique is not new, but remains relatively unusual – and could be replicated elsewhere. It sees router vulnerabilities exploited to gain access to the victim’s router and its DNS configuration changed, allowing the attacker to redirect DNS requests to a malicious server.\nVictims may not even receive a warning that they are connecting to an insecure site if the actors use ‘SSL stripping’ or other techniques to overcome SSL/TLS certificate validation issues.\nHome routers can sometimes be seen as ‘soft targets’, with their security being given a relatively low priority. Installing the latest router updates is recommended, as is using ad blockers to mitigate malvertising.\nThe NCSC advise home users to deploy patches on their wireless network infrastructure such as wireless routers and wireless access points, as this will protect traffic from all devices while they are connected to that network. Wireless routers issued by major ISPs may automatically update once a patch becomes available. However, many Wi-Fi network devices (including some of those used by enterprises and small business) will require a manual update.\nAs discussed in the NCSC password guidance, we also recommend changing default passwords on devices such as routers and wireless access points. Malware that can log in to a router using its default credentials has potential to perform a similar style of attack against a fully patched device.\nThe NCSC has also published some guidance around Internet Edge Device Security although this is aimed at organisations, rather than individuals.\nMarap and Hermes malware delivered by phishing emails\nTwo high-profile phishing campaigns have been recently reported in open sources.\nMarap, distributed by the Necurs1 botnet, is a new piece of malware, with modular functions allowing it to download further capabilities after infecting a victim. The phishing emails used to infect users have featured malicious attachments like Word documents or PDF files. To date, Marap has mostly targeted financial institutions.\nA second malware campaign underway targets victims with the Hermes 2.1 ransomware, an evolution of the same ransomware used during the 2017 attempted theft of $60 million from a Taiwan-based bank.\nFirst, the victim receives an email titled “Invoice Due”. It claims an outstanding invoice - attached as a Word document – is due and urges the victim to complete the transaction quickly. The document is protected by a password, contained within the email, giving the campaign added credibility.\nWhen opened, the Word document prompts the victim to enable macros. If enabled, the AZORult trojan will be executed, downloading Hermes 2.1 ransomware and encrypting all files on the system. As with many other ransomware variants, a ransom note will then prompt the victim to pay, via cryptocurrencies, to have their files decrypted.\nNewer and patched versions of the applications Marap is currently targeting may be able to better defend against the original attack using malicious documents. The NCSC recommends disabling Office macros as discussed in published guidance here. There is also guidance available that can help users detect and avoid common phishing attacks as well as protecting your organisation against ransomware.\nFraud,\u202fcyber\u202fcrime\u202fand phishing attempts should be\u202freported online to Action Fraud or\u202fby\u202fcalling\u202f0300 123 2040.

What about your hardware?\nResearchers at the DEF CON 2018 cyber security convention revealed that they could access an internal network using legacy technology – a fax machine.\nFax is now viewed by many as obsolete, meaning its security is potentially overlooked. However, faxes are not only still used, but have been integrated into printers and photocopiers. Fax machines use protocols developed in the 1980s; in this case, the researchers used these old protocols to exploit modern printers.\nThe impact of not upgrading hardware can be just as great as for software, and can potentially double the risk of a breach. Legacy hardware may be unable to integrate with modern systems, may lack software updates for vulnerabilities, may fall short of regulatory requirements and may lack modern security features. It may also provide an easy access point for cyber actors to gain access to networks and conduct further operations.\nWhere possible, both software and hardware should be updated. The benefits of upgrading systems typically outweigh the risks of upkeeping a legacy system.\nData breaches fueling phishing scams\nAn ongoing email scam claims to plant spyware on a victim’s computer or phone and to record them visiting adult websites. $1,000 in Bitcoin is then demanded to prevent wider release of the video.\nSuch scam emails are common. However, in an attempt to convince the victim of its authenticity, this campaign has included both the victim’s password and, more recently, a partial phone number in the threatening emails. It is unclear how the scammers obtained these details, but recent or historic data breaches are a likely source.\nData breaches are common and have occurred through a variety of methods. Just this week, holiday firm Butlin’s said over 30,000 customer records, including names, email addresses and phone numbers, were stolen following a phishing email. The NCSC has issued phishing guidance for organisations.\nWhilst there is no evidence linking the details used in this email campaign with this breach, the use of compromised personal data in combination with large scale scam emails increases the potency of an old threat.\nThe Action Fraud website features advice on protecting against phishing.

131,131,10th August 2018,"[""Social engineering to gain access: SIM swapping\nSIM swapping (also known as ‘SIM splitting’) emerged several years ago but is on the increase as mobile phone numbers become more widely used as part of security checks. The scam sees attackers access victims’ texts, calls and other sensitive information, including security codes used as part of two-factor authentication (2FA).\nTo be successful, attackers first need personal information, gleaned through various forms of phishing, purchasing victims’ details from organised crime networks, or by conducting open source research. Social media sites can also contain sufficient information for attackers to masquerade as genuine customers.\nNext, the attacker contacts the victim’s mobile phone provider, answers basic security questions and convinces the provider to transfer the phone number to a new SIM. The attacker (who has the new SIM) then has access, while the genuine account owner is blocked.\nThe attacker may then contact the victim’s bank, posing as the victim and claiming to have forgotten a PIN number or other details. The bank will usually send a text message containing a new activation code, allowing allow the attacker to take funds directly from the bank account.\nMost victims will not discover they have been compromised until they are unable to make a call or send a text message.\nSIM swapping is not new, but, with the increased use of smartphones for security checks for Internet banking and other financial transactions, incidents will likely be on the increase. UK banks are aware of SIM swapping and have taken steps to improve security after a number of cases in 2016.\nAction Fraud, the UK’s National Fraud and Cyber Crime Reporting Centre, has previously issued SIM swap fraud warnings and advice on their website. The NCSC has recently published its 2FA guidance for individuals.\nUS payment processing services targeted by BGP hijacking attacks\nThree United States payment processing companies were reportedly targeted by Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) hijacking attacks on their DNS servers in July.\nBGP is a key protocol used for routing internet traffic around the world. The security of the internet as a whole depends on routing security, making BGP one of the major security issues; however, security was not built into BGP, which is decades old.\nThese Internet routing attacks were designed to redirect traffic directed at the payment processors to servers controlled by malicious actors, who would then attempt to steal the data.\nThe affected vendors have not commented so far, and there is no information on what, if any, data was compromised.\nIn April 2018, a similar attack affected traffic to and from Amazon's Route 53 DNS service and allowed traffic directed at MyEtherWallet to be redirected to a fake version of the site hosted in Russia. The attack, featured in our Threat Report on 4 May, saw hackers steal $160,000 worth of cryptocurrency.\nIn the UK, the NCSC’s Active Cyber Defence Programme is working to mitigate the potential for UK BGP attacks.\nBitpaymer: Cyber attack against Alaskan local government\nThe Alaskan local government borough of Matanuska-Susitna (Mat-Su) has confirmed they suffered a large scale, disruptive cyber attack in July, caused by a multi-faceted malware package containing Bitpaymer ransomware.\nThe malware infected virtually all of Mat-Su’s IT infrastructure and saw the borough revert to typewriters and hand-written receipts.\nAntivirus software indicated that the Emotet banking trojan had infected many of the borough’s Windows 7 systems. As IT technicians removed the trojan, Bitpaymer ransomware was activated and spread throughout the network causing the following effects:\nMost workstations and servers rendered inoperable\nTelephone and email networks knocked offline\nSwipe card door entry disrupted\nUser credential database access for the attacker\nThe scale of damage and disruption caused was more serious than previous Bitpaymer attacks, such as one that affected several Scottish hospitals in August 2017, and with which the NCSC assisted.\nAlthough the path to compromise is unclear, Bitpaymer has previously used Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) brute forcing to gain access to a network before spreading the malware manually on each system.\nThe NCSC has published advice on ransomware mitigation measures and incident management, as well as the importance of updating operating systems.\nMalware targets cryptocurrency ATMs\nTrend Micro have reported that malware specifically designed to target cryptocurrency ATMs is being sold on the DarkNet for $25,000 by an apparently established user who regularly sells ATM and other financially-related malware.\nThe malware, advertised as exploiting a service vulnerability and accompanied by a ready-to-use card once purchased, purports to allow the user to steal Bitcoin worth 6,750 USD/EUR/GBP at a time from bitcoin exchanges.\nThe Bitcoin news portal Bitcoinist says there are around 3,500 cryptocurrency ATMs across the world (compared to around 300 million traditional flat currency ATMs) but this number is set to rise if the trend follows last year’s four-fold increase.\nThere is currently a lack of standard security and verification standards for cryptocurrencies, and an ever-growing number of cryptocurrency offerings and exchanges. While the price and popularity of cryptocurrencies continue to grow, we assess that illicit actors will increase efforts to obtain and profit from these currencies including through theft, speculation, fraud, illicit mining, and abuse of new cryptocurrency offerings.\nIncrease of mobile phone enabled fraud\nLast week the social news aggregator Reddit reported a data breach that saw hackers able to access a backup system containing user data, including email addresses, and a 2007 database with usernames and hashed passwords. Several Reddit employees' accounts connected to cloud and hosting providers were compromised.\nThe company employed an SMS-based two-factor authentication system where a one-time passcode was used to access systems, along with a password. The hack was accomplished by intercepting SMS messages, circumventing Reddit’s 2FA system. See the NCSC’s advice following the Reddit breach.\nSMS-based verification tokens can be stolen with a variety of well-known techniques, including social engineering, mobile malware, exploitation and intercept of legacy telephone signalling systems, or by directly intercepting and decrypting signals from cell towers.\nIn May 2017, a major German mobile service provider, confirmed that cyber criminals had exploited signalling vulnerabilities to bypass 2FA to make unauthorised withdrawals from users' bank accounts. After compromising victim computers, the attackers purchased access to a fake telecoms provider and set up redirects from the victims' phone numbers to lines controlled by them; hence the 2FA confirmation SMS messages were rerouted.\nSIM swapping is another increasingly popular method. See the related concurrent article ‘Social engineering to gain access: SIM swapping’\nLast week, Californian authorities stated that a 20-year-old college student was facing 28 criminal charges for targeting and hijacking more than 40 phone numbers belonging mainly to Bitcoin investors and had allegedly stolen $5 million worth of Bitcoin.\nThese recent attacks have stimulated debate about the insecurities surrounding the use of SMS-based authentication. In the face of a determined attacker, SMS-based 2FA will not provide absolute protection, but despite the flaws in the system SMS 2FA is still better than not using 2FA at all.\nThe NCSC published 2FA guidance for individuals this week.""]",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-10th-august-2018

No longer. In today’s connected world – you may have just sold a computer on wheels.\nAs of late 2017 there were around 9 million internet-connected cars on UK roads. Most new cars have features that allow the owner to interact with the vehicle, even when nowhere near it. This varies from the ability to set climate control, through to uploading sat nav destination details and more. This information is then stored in the online account associated with the car.\nThis data is not the only personal information that remains with the car. For instance, phones that have been paired with the car should also be unpaired when the car is sold.\nWhen selling an old phone or device most people would ensure that any personal data on it was completely wiped. The same principle applies when an internet-connected car is sold; it is generally the seller’s responsibility to disable the online account that they used with that car.\nMany car manufacturers and dealers state this in their terms and conditions. However, some customers may not read them that closely and fail to delete their personal accounts and access. When the car is then sold on, the previous owner can track and monitor the car’s location and other data without the new owner’s knowledge.\nThe key message is to treat a modern car like any other connected device that is being sold: delete all personal data and disable the account that has been used with the car. Privacy is already seen as a key issue with phones, tablets, and laptops. Cars and other internet connected devices should also be added to the list.\nSocial engineering as a malware delivery mechanism: technical support fraud\nWe are all used to warnings about the need to keep security patches up-to-date in an effort to make our computers harder to exploit, but hackers have long been using social engineering alone as a means to exploit us and our computers. One type of scam – technical support fraud – seems to be on the rise again.\nIt sees hackers pose as employees of trusted organisations such as an IT company, Internet Service Provider, bank or, as in April 2018, even as Action Fraud. They phone the intended victim, claiming there is a problem with their account/internet/computer, and they need remote access to the victim’s device to demonstrate and fix it.\nGranting them this access gives the hackers complete control. They can, for example, install a key logger or other malware, launch phishing attacks against the victim’s contacts or access the victim’s personal information, including passwords and banking details.\nTechnical support fraud affects businesses as well as individuals, with some hackers regarding businesses as more lucrative victims.\nThis technique is not new, but it appears to be on the increase. Microsoft reported that it had received 153,000 complaints about technical support fraud from around 183 countries in 2017, a 24% increase from the previous year. Although the hackers can be very convincing, most organisations do not make unsolicited phone calls offering to fix problems.\nNot your typical ransomware\nWe previously reported on the SamSam ransomware attack on the Colorado transport system, the city of Atlanta and the ongoing costs of the ransomware attacks. A recent report by cyber security company Sophos has shed further light on SamSam – its evolution, the revenue it has generated and details of the attacker(s), who is yet to be identified. Key findings from Sophos include:\nSamSam has earned more than $5.9m (£4.5m) from ransom payments since late 2015. The attacker’s revenue now averages around $300,000 (£250,000) per month.\nMost of the known victims are based in the United States (74%), but other regions are known to have suffered attacks, including the UK (8%).\nMedium to large public sector organisations in healthcare, education, and government account for about 50% of the total number of known victims, with the rest in unidentified parts of the private sector.\nThe ransom demands have increased considerably, and the tempo of attacks shows no sign of abating.\nThe attacker is thorough and consistent in covering their tracks and making analysis difficult.\nThe SamSam campaign operates differently from most ransomware threats. Most malicious actors perform mass distribution schemes to spread ransomware through email spamming or malware-infected adverts. In the case of SamSam, the attacker is patient, persistent and selective, targeting one victim at a time.\nThe best way for organisations to protect themselves against SamSam, and many other attacks, is to reduce their threat profile and not be an easy target in the first place. The NCSC has issued guidance on mitigating ransomware and other forms of malware.\nRecent data breach investigations highlight ongoing data storage concerns\nRetailer Dixons Carphone and shipping company Clarksons both experienced compromises on their systems in 2017 leading to large amounts of data being stolen.\nBoth companies have recently reported the results of investigations indicating that the scale and extent of each compromise was significantly greater than originally reported.\nThis is not unusual. The full extent of data breaches is often not discovered or reported until long after the initial breach, which can lead to delays in alerting affected individuals and provide a wider window of opportunity for cyber criminals to monetise the data (e.g. through spear-phishing campaigns or using online banking credentials).\nTherefore, even individuals who may not have been affected by reported breaches should be vigilant. Business best practice is to regularly review personal data held and only retain that which is necessary and then ensure that this data is sufficiently protected.\nThe NCSC website has published updated guidance on the Dixons Carphone plc breach. It also has detailed guidance on phishing as well as the threat following data breaches.\nFollowing US arrests, prolific cyber gang, FIN7 now smaller\nThree members of the prolific ‘FIN7’ hacking group have been arrested, the US Department of Justice announced this week.\nIt is alleged that the group stole over 15 million customer card records from over 3,600 locations, impacting at least 100 businesses in the US, UK, France and Australia, predominantly in the restaurant, gaming and hospitality industries.\nThe group, which has also been referred to as Carbanak and the Navigator Group, used phishing and spear-phishing emails, such as complaint emails with malicious attachments, to target their victims, often accompanied with a telephone call for authenticity.\nOnce the attachment was opened, the group used malware to steal card details which they then used or sold for profit on the criminal darknet.\nThe FIN7 group have also purportedly recruited hackers using a front company, Combi Security, to provide a guise of legitimacy.\nOne of the individuals is in the US, the other two are in Poland and Spain, though the US is seeking to have both extradited. The investigation into the remainder of the group is continuing.\nPhishing is a widely used technique which criminals use to try to obtain access to systems.

The data included names, national identity card numbers, addresses, gender, race and dates of birth, with 160,000 of these also containing the records of dispensed medicines.\nThe Cyber Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) said the attack was ""deliberate, targeted and well-planned"". They determined that attackers accessed the network by breaching a front-end workstation, managing to get privileged access to the database over time. Records were then downloaded between 27th June and 4th July and transferred to servers overseas. Victims included several Singaporean ministers, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.\nThis latest incident adds to a trend of healthcare breaches where personal data was targeted. The Norwegian health sector suffered a comparable breach in January this year which exposed personal data of three million patients. The sector is a ripe target for malicious actors due to the aggregation of large amounts of personal data often containing identifiable information which may be used for identity theft or for further targeted attacks.\nA variety of threat actors are highly likely to continue targeting the healthcare sector. This will be intensified as technology becomes more ingrained into core healthcare systems, increasing the threat surface for attacks that steal data and disrupt services.\nThe threat from Emotet dropper malware\nThe US Department of Homeland Security has warned of the threat to network systems from Emotet. Emotet is an advanced banking trojan that primarily functions as a downloader or dropper of other banking trojans. It is disseminated through malicious attachments or links in email, which often appear as quite convincing invoices, receipts and shipping notices using branding familiar to the recipient. Emotet has worm-like features that result in rapidly spreading network-wide infections; it can evade typical signature-based detection, is Virtual Machine aware and has several methods for maintaining persistence on a network. The US alert reports that Emotet infections on local government systems have cost up to $1 million per incident to remediate.\nCyber security companies have reported that Emotet has been used to deliver a variety of second-stage malware payloads such as the banking trojans Dridex and Trickbot, spambot malware and ransomware. Palo Alto Networks report that the Emotet and Trickbot combination is particularly potent as it combines the mass distribution properties of Emotet with the network lateral movement capabilities of Trickbot. A Trend Micro report from 2017 showed the UK as the next most targeted country after the US followed by Canada, Mexico and Germany.\nThose organisations with good spam filtering, who only give administrator rights when appropriate and with proper system administration and up-to-date Windows hosts, are at a lower risk of infection.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-27th-july-2018
134,134,20th July 2018,"[""Are weak login credentials allowing criminals to bypass your security?\nA study by cyber security firm McAfee has found that criminal marketplaces on the dark web are selling Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) access for as little as $3 and, in some instances, offering up to 40,000 separate RDP connections. These RDP accesses are said to include government departments and the security system of a major international airport.\nRDP software allows a user’s desktop environment to be run remotely from another device. This can be very useful for customer service support and remote working. McAfee reports that cyber criminals scan the Internet for systems that accept RDP connections and use a ‘brute force’ attacks to gain access to systems with weaker login credentials.\nRDP vulnerabilities potentially allow an attacker to obtain full access and control of the system. Once access is obtained, the attacker can steal data, install malware or conduct other malicious activities.\nChanging default settings, using more secure passwords, two-factor authentication and limiting the number of login attempts would lower the risk of RDP credentials being stolen.\nPlease see the NCSC’s guidance on passwords and remote working for how to lower the risks.\n\nSpanish telecoms provider Telefonica suffers security breach\nAccording to media reports, Spanish telecoms provider Telefónica, has suffered the largest data breach in Spanish telecommunications history.\n\nIt has been widely reported that the breach exposed the personal and financial information of millions of Spanish users of the company's landline, broadband and television services under the Movistar brand. It was revealed that anyone with an account could view other users' personal data by manipulating part of the URL within the customer portal.\nTelefónica reported that mitigation measures had been taken immediately and the vulnerability had been resolved overnight.\nThe Telefónica breach was reported to the Spanish Agency for Data Protection (AEPD), the national agency in charge of enforcing the new GDPR data protection rules. Under GDPR, Telefónica may face a fine between €10 million and €20 million, or a fine that's the equivalent of 2% to 4% of its annual turnover.\nMedia claim some 85% of Telefónica’s computers were affected by the WannaCry ransomware attack in May 2017.\nThe breach could have been due to insufficient security testing during the commissioning process of their online portal. Despite significant investment in new security systems, a relatively trivial oversight has enabled anyone to bypass these controls; highlighting that the simplicity of a breach-causing error often stands in stark contrast to the magnitude of the resulting consequences.\nThe NCSC has published cyber attack deterrence guidance for any company designing, building and operating digital services.\n\nThe threat from the inside\nSeveral attempted data theft incidents in recent weeks have highlighted the significant insider threat to businesses developing high-value intellectual property. These incidents had the potential to introduce a potentially catastrophic financial and or reputational impact on the company:\nA disgruntled Tesla employee reportedly stole a large volume of sensitive data from company servers, allegedly passed the details on to an unknown third party after being refused promotion within the company\nA former Apple employee was reportedly arrested after stealing data related to the company’s research and development of self-driving cars. Suspicious activity on the employee’s user accounts during the last few days of his employment sparked an investigation into his activities, revealing the theft of Apple trade secrets relating to autonomous vehicles\nIsraeli security company, NSO, reportedly discovered an employee had stolen proprietary surveillance software from the company and offered it on the dark web. A potential buyer of the stolen surveillance software informed NSO of the theft\nThe motivation for an employee to act against their employer can vary widely and may include financial greed, state-sponsored espionage, or even revenge for a workplace grievance. Similarly, some data breaches can be caused inadvertently by well-intentioned employees failing to follow, or deliberately circumventing, security procedures, where there is inadequate training, or when processes are seen as overly bureaucratic.\nCompanies should follow thorough due diligence by ensuring appropriate security-related training is provided, including the identification and reporting of suspicious activity. IT hardening and user monitoring strategies, including auditing of user privileges, are also important to prevent malicious cyber activity. As the Apple example illustrates, well implemented joiner/mover/leaver (JML) security practices, can be essential in preventing valuable data falling into the wrong hands.\nThe NCSC has issued guidance on mitigating insider risks with IT security.""]",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-20th-july-2018

Polar have since published a statement and FAQ for its users.\nThis follows similar revelations involving the Strava application in January 2018, where activity in and around military sites was identified. In this case, Polar users are only affected if they have opted-in to also use the extra Polar Flow application.\nThe researchers reported that the social layer of the Polar Flow application provided more information than was available via Strava. Researchers were able to track a user’s exercise route and link it to home address information and social media profiles.\nPolar have since suspended the Global Activity Map functionality, which had been in use since 2014, due to privacy concerns. According to Polar, the application is used by ‘millions of users’.\nThere are obvious health benefits in using devices to better plan and track individual fitness programs. However, users should consider how they share that data including which social services they choose to link that data with.\nWhen using a fitness tracker, users should consider when and where to use it and which product offers the best privacy options.

Almost five million users may also have had their phone numbers stolen, although Timehop have said they have detected no unauthorised access to photos or posts at any point.\nThe breach reportedly occurred from access to the company’s cloud computing provider using stolen credentials in December 2017 and early 2018, with the theft of data happening in a two-hour window on 4th July before access was stopped.\nTimehop has made it clear that this breach was enabled by the lack of two-factor authentication (2FA) on one of their cloud computing accounts, which has now been added. Users will also have to re-authenticate the Timehop app on their social media accounts next time they use it.\nDue to the theft of phone numbers and dates of birth, users of Timehop should be aware of the potential for unauthorised access to other accounts which are secured using these details as security factors.\nThe NCSC has issued guidance on both cloud security and the use of 2FA to protect online services.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-13th-july-2018
136,136,6th July 2018,"['Clipboard hijacking malware\nThis week, a newly-discovered clipboard hijacking malware sample has been seen monitoring over 2.3 million cryptocurrency addresses.\nThe malware scans the Windows Clipboard for cryptocurrency addresses, switching legitimate ones for addresses owned by the attacker. The malware runs in the background and as processes look genuine there are no tell-tale signs of infection.\nClipboard hijacking, however, is not a new threat. Historically, earlier versions of web browsers would allow websites to silently read the data stored on the Windows Clipboard. Today, updated browsers prompt the user on screen to allow access to the clipboard.\nIn June, a cyber security company identified a clipboard hijacking malware campaign targeting Bitcoin and Ethereum users, infecting over 300,000 computers.\nDue to the complex nature of cryptocurrency addresses, transferring funds requires users to copy a destination address from one application into memory and then paste it into the program they are using to send money. Attackers are likely to have noticed this behaviour and created the malware to take advantage of this.\nThere is no evidence to suggest that any other information is being taken as a result of this clipboard hijacking but, since the clipboard is often used as a place to hold passwords and other sensitive information, users should be vigilant. If you are sending cryptocurrency it is recommended that the destination address is double checked to make sure it has not been replaced with a different one.\nAs the price and popularity of cryptocurrencies continues to grow, we assess that illicit actors will increase efforts to obtain and profit from them, including through theft, speculation, fraud, illicit mining, and abuse of new cryptocurrency offerings.\nIt is recommended that devices and software, including antivirus, is kept up-to-date and patched where necessary. The NCSC has also issued mitigating malware guidance.\nThird party apps can access your email\nWhen downloading an app, users may be asked to grant certain permissions, which often include providing access to their emails to the app developer.\nRecent media reporting indicates that third party companies are in some cases given access to users’ Gmail inboxes when the user signs up for email-based services.\nSome third party companies have reportedly used computers and, on occasions, employees to scan the email data. The companies stated that they did not require the user\'s specific permission as the practice was covered by their user agreements, and that they have strict protocols in place for employees who read emails.\nGoogle has stated that ""only apps which have been vetted and are trusted by our organisation are used,"" although details of how many apps have access to Gmail have not been disclosed.\nThere is no indication that third party developers have misused any data to which they have had access. Nevertheless, users are advised to pay close attention to the permissions allowed and who they are granted to.\nIt should be noted that apps which may have only been used once in the past may still provide access to a user\'s emails.\nConcerned Gmail users should visit Google\'s security check-up page.\nSignificant data breaches\nRecent weeks have seen the announcement of several significant data breaches affecting major companies in the UK and internationally.\nSome have resulted from poorly configured servers or vulnerabilities in web applications:\nIn early June, in one of the largest data breaches ever disclosed, a security researcher reportedly discovered a publicly exposed server belonging to the data brokerage firm Exactis. The exposed dataset allegedly contained nearly 340 million individual records relating to hundreds of millions of US citizens and millions of US businesses. Whilst the breach does not appear to have exposed payment or social security-related information, other sensitive personal details were included in the dataset.\nOn 14 June, hotel booking provider Fastbookings discovered that a vulnerability in a web application hosted on its server had been exploited by a malicious actor to install malware. The cyber thief reportedly used this to steal the personal details of guests from up to 4,000 hotels in 100 different countries.\nOther breaches have highlighted the ongoing cyber threat to businesses’ supply chains:\nIn early June, Australia-based PageUp, which runs online recruitment for Whitbread businesses, including Costa Coffee and Premier Inn, admitted a data breach. The breach reportedly included personal and biographical details of all applicants to Whitbread businesses, though it is not clear how far back the breach extends.\nOn 23 June, Ticketmaster UK reported malicious software on a customer support product hosted by Inbenta Technologies, an external third-party supplier to Ticketmaster. Information compromised may include a range of customers’ personal and payment details. Ticketmaster has stated that fewer than 5% of their customers were affected by the incident; up to 2 million customers who visited the site from February 2018 were notified by Ticketmaster, with a forced password reset as a precautionary measure. The NCSC has issued advice for Tickemaster customers.\nThe NCSC website sets out clear and actionable advice to help organisations protect their bulk personal data from cyber attacks. The NCSC also recommends that users enable multi-factor authentication on any service that supports it, which will help protect user accounts if they are involved in a data breach.

The victim is then redirected to a fake Adidas website asking them to pay a small fee to receive the shoes (and an ongoing monthly charge, which is hidden in the small print).\nThe fake Adidas site uses homographic web links, where a character is replaced by a similar looking symbol:\nExample 1: www. thisisarealwebsite .org.com\nExample 2: www. thisisarea|website .org.com\nThe letter ‘l’ in the second website name is a symbol, but at a quick glance it is not immediately obvious. Fraudsters are increasingly using this technique and we advise readers to study web links carefully before clicking on them.\nThe NCSC has further information on how to protect yourself from phishing scams here. Keeping your antivirus software up to date will, in most cases, help identify any malicious files that you attempt to download. For further support, please read 10 Steps to Cyber Security.\nIs your device earning money for cyber criminals?\nRecent reports have suggested a substantial increase in ‘cryptojacking’, where cyber criminals install malware onto a victim’s devices and use them to mine cryptocurrency.\nCryptojacking malware is reportedly becoming harder to detect and sometimes operates to coincide with times where the device is not normally used, and thus remains undetected.\nThis type of malware is increasingly being found on devices across multiple sectors and is evolving to use the processing power of internet-connected devices, such as TVs. Some aggressive mining malware has also been found to damage devices.\nIn response to the increase in cryptomining, Apple has recently introduced App Store guidelines prohibiting it. It is uncertain whether other providers will follow.\nCryptomining malware is a low-cost method of earning money and cyber criminals will almost certainly continue to develop and adapt it, as long as cryptocurrencies are of value.\nTo prevent the installation of criminal malware, please follow the NCSC’s advice and guidance.\nAttackers target cryptocurrency software\nOn 15 June, Syscoin, a cryptocurrency that advertises its instant transactions, announced that its Github account had been compromised just under a week earlier.\nAn unknown user had uploaded a modified version of the program containing malicious code. The software was otherwise identical to the original program but was detected by Windows Defender SmartScreen due to its lack of signature. As the code had been modified it was no longer recognised as legitimate and designated as being from an 'unknown publisher'.\nGithub consequently advised developers of cryptocurrencies and other software to implement two factor authentication (2FA) on their accounts where possible. Developers were also advised to check the integrity of published software on repository sites.\nUsers should be cautious when downloading from online sources. It is good practice to maintain up-to-date antivirus software and avoid software from unknown publishers.\nThe number of systems infected by the malicious code – and the exact method used to compromise the account in this instance – are not known. The account breach demonstrates the continuing threat posed to cryptocurrency software by attackers exploiting the cryptocurrency boom.\nThe NCSC has issued guidance on 2FA, password management, mitigating the threat of malware and identity authentication.\nThe NCSC website also maintains a general guide on measures to improve security online.\nGood cyber hygiene can help fend off LokiBot\nFraudulent account activity and identity theft are some of the most common threats on the internet.

However, Coinrail claim that two thirds of the stolen coins have either been frozen or withdrawn so far, with further recovery action likely to happen.\nAlthough the attack did not feature any of the major cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum or Dogecoin, many recorded large losses in value after the attack was announced, with Bitcoin dropping to its lowest value in two months.\nWhile cryptocurrencies remain valuable, it is almost certain that they, and associated services such as exchanges and wallet providers, will remain an attractive target for cyber criminals.\nEven smaller exchanges have sufficient funds to make them worthwhile targets for cyber criminals. The Coinrail attack represents another notable attack against an exchange following the Coincheck, Youbit (twice), EtherDelta and NiceHash thefts that have taken place since December 2017.\nThe ongoing costs of a ransomware attack\nWe have previously reported on the SamSam ransomware attack on the City of Atlanta (initial report and a follow-up report on the costs of recovery). Recent media reporting has revealed that video files containing police dashcam footage were encrypted during the attack and cannot be recovered.\nIt is concerning that important policing processes such as evidence gathering, or even decisions around guilt and innocence, could potentially be impacted by a ransomware outbreak. Backing-up these video files to a secure location would have negated the impact of their loss.\nWe previously reported that the ransom demand amounted to around $55,000 and that the recovery costs were $2.66m. However, more recent reporting suggests that the recovery costs have exceeded $5m and that a further $9.5m has been requested for ongoing remediation costs.\nWhile it may seem tempting to pay the ransom in such circumstances, victims should note that there is no guarantee that paying the ransom will enable the recovery of the files. Some ransomware variants do not have the ability to allow for the decryption of the files. Victim organisations should also note that whatever vulnerability was exploited to enable the attack will still need to be resolved, and that anyone who pays a ransom will be an attractive target for further attacks by the same or other groups.\nThe costs and effort of hardening your systems against a ransomware attack are multiplied if the work has to be undertaken during a crisis. It is worth remembering that ransomware is only a viable activity for organised criminals if victims pay the ransom.\nThe NCSC has issued guidance on mitigating ransomware and other forms of malware\nProwli botnet infects over 40,000 networked devices\nOver recent months, Guardicore researchers have identified a cyber crime group they have called “Prowli”, who have been conducting a wide-ranging campaign using an array of techniques to infect more than 40,000 machines at 9,000 companies globally.\nThey have used various techniques like exploits and password brute-forcing to spread malware and take over devices, such as website content management systems (CMS), web servers, modems, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.\nOnce a device is compromised, a self-propagating worm is installed to exploit vulnerabilities and expands the botnet by identifying and spreading to new victims. The group have used multiple avenues to generate money from the compromised systems including installing cryptocurrency mining software, as well as redirecting people from legitimate compromised websites to malicious domains hosting scam websites (i.e. fraudulent tech support, scam products and fake browser extensions).\nThe attackers have compromised a range of organisations of all types and sizes, without targeting a specific sector. It is highly likely that the operation was intentionally designed and optimised to maximise profits for the money-motivated cyber criminals.\nThis campaign comes in the wake of several other similar large botnets which are attacking networked devices. To minimise the threat, users should ensure regular patching is undertaken across all device types. Where possible, users should set devices to automatically apply all security updates as they become available.\nThe NCSC website features advice and guidance for patch management, and readers should also follow the 10 steps to Cyber Security.

Following the publication of Mirai’s source code numerous variants have been observed, often competing against each other.\nOwari scans for known vulnerabilities found not just in IoT devices but in a wide range of networked devices. It infects vulnerable devices to integrate them within the botnet. Owari makes money by offering web stressing/DDoS as a service to customers via the dark web. It was also designed to search for and remove other malware already on a device. The researchers were able to analyse how Owari operates and found information on historical DDoS attacks carried out against various targets some of which were associated with rival IoT botnets.\nDespite researchers gaining access to Owari’s C&C server, it will almost certainly make little difference as according to researchers most C&C botnet servers are throwaway by design, with a shelf life of about one week. Owari will probably simply appear elsewhere on the internet.\nIt is ironic that a malware system designed to compromise systems with weak security credentials is protected with weak credentials itself.\nIt is highly likely that malware developers will continue to use Mirai variants similar to Owari as a mechanism to quickly develop botnets capable of delivering DDoS attacks, data theft or into swarms of malware proxies and cryptominers.\nThe NCSC is working with DCMS to establish a code of practice for IoT security.

These fake text messages and phishing emails often contain malicious links which direct customers straight to the scammers.\nThe 2018 FIFA World Cup taking place in Russia in June/July has led to a rise in phishing scams. Scammers are exploiting the willingness of football fans to pay inflated ticket prices with fake websites being set up to lure victims. Fans buying tickets from these sources run the risk of receiving fake tickets or none at all. Even more concerning, the fraudsters will acquire payment details, leaving fans exposed to further potential online fraud.\nFake World Cup-associated websites have also been set up offering accommodation, flights and 'official' hospitality at stadiums. Phishing emails have been sent advising users that they have won a World Cup Lottery and to send details and a small cash sum to claim their 'prize'. The NCSC recently published a blog outlining how fans can best secure devices and key accounts when travelling this summer.\nPeople may lower their guard in the context of high-profile or emotionally-engaging events, making these an ideal hook for fraudsters to exploit.

141,141,25th May 2018,"[""GDPR and what it means for cyber security\nThe General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) comes into force today, 25th May, setting clear instructions about the appropriate technical and organisational measures that must be in place to securely process personal data.\nWhile there has been a lot of messaging around GDPR, what you may not know is that the NCSC has been working closely with the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) to develop a set of security outcomes. The guidance provides an overview of what GDPR says about security and describes a set of related outcomes which all organisations that process personal data should seek to achieve.\nSome overarching information around GDPR has been produced by the NCSC which serves as a good starting point before tackling GDPR security outcomes. The ICO, which is the UK’s supervisory authority for GDPR, has also published plenty of useful guidance on its own website too.\nThe NCSC’s Principal Technical Director for Risk Management Capability, Ian M, has also blogged about GDPR which may be a good starting point for those looking for more information about the impact upon cyber security.\nChildren’s details leaked in monitoring app breach\nMedia reports detail an Amazon S3 bucket misconfiguration that has led to a serious data breach. According to ZDnet, a UK-based security researcher found two public S3 buckets belonging to TeenSafe, a mobile app for iOS and Android, that allows parents to monitor the texts, calls, locations and social media exchanges of their children. The buckets were reportedly left unsecured and accessible to anyone without a password. This breach exposed at least 10,200 records covering the preceding three months, including children’s Apple ID and plaintext passwords, device names and their device’s unique identifier.\nThis latest incident is another instance of an Amazon S3 Bucket being misconfigured, making it publicly accessible. This breach is particularly serious due to the potential for online predators to access the personal details of minors. It may also leave the affected children (and their parents) more vulnerable to identity theft in the future.\nBy default, all new Amazon S3 resources including buckets are private, and since November they have also been encrypted. For a bucket and its contents to be made public, it must be configured to be so. Permissions inheritance can be complicated, so AWS provides a free tool for their customers to identify any buckets that are publicly accessible.\nIf you are using or considering using Cloud technology, we recommend reading the NCSC's\u202fCloud Security Collection\u202fand\u202fImplementing the Cloud Security Principles.\n‘Sharenting’: increasing the risk of identify fraud?\nResearch by Barclays Bank has indicated that the sharing of family life on social media by parents, known as ‘sharenting’, could leave their children exposed to online identity fraud when they grow up.\nFor example, a photo celebrating a child’s birthday reveals a date of birth; a reference to their first pet could be used as an answer to a bank security question; or the child’s favourite football team may also be a useful clue to a password. If this information is obtained by fraudsters it gives them a head-start in breaking into their future online lives. Also given that many adults use this kind of information when choosing passwords, this can also expose the parent to online fraud.\nIt is advisable for users to check the privacy settings on social media accounts.\nThe NCSC has also provided guidance on choosing good passwords, and CPNI has produced some useful material on minimising your digital footprint.\nFor those building services, it is advisable not to use easily discoverable information for password resets.\nUp to 800,000 DrayTek routers at risk due to zero-day exploit\nNetwork equipment vendor Draytek has said several of its wireless routers (details here) are vulnerable to a suspected ‘zero-day’ exploit allowing hackers to remotely change the device's settings. This could allow attackers to re-direct traffic or conduct man-in-the-middle attacks in order to steal information and credentials from users.\nResearchers suggest up to 800, 000 routers are at risk. Reports from victim IT departments suggest the exploit is bypassing password-based security and even access control lists (which restrict connections to trusted devices only). UK-based technical online forums indicate there are multiple UK victims. Draytek has issued a security advisory, encouraging users to manually update firmware.\nUsers should also ensure regular patching is undertaken across all device types. Where possible, users should set devices to automatically apply all security updates as they become available. The NCSC's approach to patch management can be found here.""]",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-25th-may-2018
142,142,18th May 2018,"[""It’s not just production that needs securing\nMost large companies will use an online development environment to build and test code prior to deployment on outward and inward facing networks.\nMuch of the code found in development environments is sensitive and critical to running and managing a business. The unauthorised disclosure of code could allow cyber actors to identify exploitable weaknesses.\nRecent open source reporting has highlighted a compromise of a company’s development environment, resulting in unauthorised access to two million lines of code, application programme interfaces and secret access keys to Amazon Web Services.\nA security researcher allegedly gained access to the development environment because both the username and password were set to “admin”, which was most likely the default setting for the environment.\nThe latest incident follows on from other reported incidents around insecure repositories and third party storage solutions, where users have failed to alter the default settings and/or configure the environments incorrectly and subsequently exposed large volumes of sensitive data.\nThe failure to secure development environments poses a number of threats to an organisation including:\nStealing of sensitive information (such as encryption and access keys, passwords, knowledge of security controls or intellectual property)\nAn attacker embedding malicious code in your project without your knowledge\nUsing a compromised development device as a proxy to further attack your build and deployment pipeline, through to production\nUnderstanding how your sensitive applications work - a first step in the planning of an attack\nThe NCSC has previously issued guidance on securing development environments as well as approaching enterprise technology with cyber security in mind.\nGDPR-inspired phishing scams\nThe imminent arrival of the new EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has gifted scammers with a new hook for sending phishing emails.\nMany internet users are now receiving emails from organisations that they have online dealings with, explaining the new regulations and asking them for permission to carry on storing their information.\nScammers have taken advantage of this to send fake GDPR-themed emails in an attempt to spread malware or steal personal data.\nApple customers, for example, have been sent a link advising users that their accounts had been “limited” due to unusual activity and then asking them to update their security information.\nUsers are then directed to a fraudulent webpage where they are asked to input security information. Once this has been completed, users are then directed back to a legitimate Apple web page.\nThe scammers also used Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) protocols when directing users to the page controlled by them, bypassing anti-phishing tools embedded in some antivirus software.\nGDPR comes into effect on 25th May 2018, so the scammers have a short window in which to use GDPR as cover for their activities.\nThe NCSC has published phishing guidance and you can also read the GDPR security outcomes that have been developed by the NCSC and the Information Commissioners Office (ICO).

143,143,11th May 2018,"['UK cyber criminal pleads guilty to selling customer credentials on the Dark Web\nA cyber criminal who hacked into the online networks of at least 200 companies worldwide recently pleaded guilty to multiple offences in court.\nGrant West, 25, who operated under the pseudonym ‘Courvoisier’, was detained in September 2017 following a two-year investigation by Scotland Yard. He was arrested on a train whilst logging on to his dark web marketplace account.\nSouthwark Crown Court heard that from at least 2015, West hacked into the online networks of Sainsburys, Asda, Apple, Uber, Ladbrokes, JustEat, Argos and others.\nThe data of thousands of customers was then stolen and used in spear-phishing scams to dupe customers into revealing their credit and debit card details, login credentials and email addresses.\nThe customer credentials were then sold on the dark web marketplace and used by other cyber criminals to make illegal purchases. Although hacking of the company websites was the major enabler of this cyber criminal activity, the spear-phishing emails ultimately led to customers unwittingly divulging their personal banking details which were then used to steal their money.\nInternet users should consider NCSC advice on phishing.\nCompanies should look at the 10 Steps to cyber security: Network Security section for guidance on how to make online networks more secure.\nTwitter Passwords Exposed\nTwitter has urged its users to change their passwords after a software bug exposed their login details.\nThe bug saw usernames and passwords written in plain text and stored in an internal log before being encrypted.\nTwitter discovered and fixed the error and have since apologised for their mistake, advising all 330 million users to change their passwords as a precautionary measure.\nDespite login credentials being made visible by the bug, Twitter are confident that no details have been compromised.\nIt is important to manage passwords effectively; never use the same password for important accounts such as banking, work accounts or cloud storage. If your password is exposed on one platform it’s possible that criminals or other threat actors might attempt to use that information in the hope of compromising others.\nThe NCSC has written a blog around password re-use, and advice to help individuals create strong passwords is available on the Cyber Aware website.\nEquifax breach Part 1: Four in five companies still using vulnerable Struts software\nAccording to a recent report by Sonatype, four in five companies have failed to patch a vulnerable component of the Apache Struts application building software package, used by thousands of business and enterprise customers to power many of their websites.\nThe 2017 Equifax breach of over 146 million records was attributed to a failure to patch the vulnerable component.\nThe Sonatype report shows that 10,801 organisations, including 57% of the Fortune Global 100 companies, downloaded vulnerable versions of Struts or its components between March 2017 and February 2018 despite patched versions being available. Only one in five companies are no longer using vulnerable versions of the software.\nAccording to Juniper Networks another networking security company, known vulnerabilities were the leading cause of data breaches during 2016, accounting for 44% of incidents.\nWhile there can be legitimate reasons for downloading older versions of software – reproducing environments, diagnosing regression issues and development use cases – users should avoid using continuity of applications and network connectivity as an excuse for failing to patch known vulnerabilities in a timely manner.\nNCSC guidance remains that for production environments users should use the latest versions of software to ensure known vulnerabilities are addressed. Where this is not possible, robust and proactive mitigations must be employed so that access to known vulnerable applications is minimised.\nThe NCSC website features advice and guidance for Patch Management, and readers should also follow the NCSC 10 steps to Cyber Security.\nEquifax breach Part 2: Further details published\nLate last week, Equifax published further details regarding the 2017 hack.\nWhilst the total number of US individuals affected has not increased, the ongoing audit has identified details of records stolen, including:\n146.6 million names\n146.6 million dates of birth\n145.5 US social security numbers\n99 million addresses\n209,000 payment cards (number and expiry date)\n20.3 million phone numbers\n1.8 million email addresses\nEquifax stated that “the additional detail provided does not identify additional consumers affected, and does not require additional consumer notifications”.\nThere was no clarification on records relating to non-US citizens including the 693,665 UK consumers who had sensitive data exposed.\nPrevious NCSC reporting on the Equifax breach.\nPlease also see the NCSC advice and guidance for Equifax customers.\nAnti-theft software exploited by state actor\nResearch by Arbor Networks has alleged that a capable state actor has hijacked software that protects users if their computers are stolen.\nThe software, called LoJack, allows administrators to remotely lock, locate and remove files from stolen computers.\nIts main customers are corporate IT-related firms that need to protect information from exploitation. It is often installed by default. However, the actor has re-configured the software for malicious use to maintain persistent access to targeted devices and communicate with command-and-control servers that the actor operates.\nMost anti-virus packages cannot detect when LoJack has been hijacked, or do not recognise the hijacked version as malicious.\nPrevious research as far back as 2009 has publicised that Lojack could be exploited.\nHowever, not all computers that use LoJack are vulnerable to compromise and data exfiltration – the attacker needs to gain initial access to the machine before they can deploy the hijacked version of LoJack to maintain persistence.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-11th-may-2018
144,144,4th May 2018,"['\'Orangeworm\' Group Targeting Healthcare Industry\nSymantec have reported that a group they have tracked as ‘Orangeworm’ since 2015 are targeting the healthcare industry in the United States, Asia and Europe, including the UK.\n40% of their attacks focus on the healthcare industry. Other industries targeted are either closely related to healthcare or part of the supply chain, including IT, manufacturing, logistics and agriculture. It is likely that the supply chain has been deliberately targeted to gain access to their customers’ environments.\nAfter gaining access to the target environment the group deploy a custom malware trojan, allowing attackers to remotely access the compromised device. The malware collects information about the computer to determine if it may be of interest, before ""aggressively"" copying itself to other systems with open network shares.\nThe trojan uses an older propagation method that mainly works on older operating systems, and the health sector is known to use legacy systems on older platforms. It has been discovered on devices hosting software used for high-tech imaging devices such as MRI and X-rays, as well as devices used to complete consent forms.\nThe group\'s exact motives are unclear. However, it is likely that they are interested in obtaining personal or proprietary information, possibly for identity theft, extortion or corporate espionage.\nIn the UK, the Department of Health and Social Care recently announced a funding package to improve their cyber security capabilities. The package of measures includes ensuring that all UK health and care organisations are using the latest Windows 10 software with up-to-date security settings.\nThe implementation of this upgrade and other basic hygiene measures should prevent malware, like the Kwampirs trojan, from exploiting NHS legacy vulnerabilities.\nOrganisations concerned about this type of activity should read the NCSC’s guidance on malware protection and supply chain security.\nDCMS Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2018\nThe latest Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Cyber Security Breaches Survey has shown that more businesses are now adopting the NCSC’s Cyber Essentials scheme.\nThe scheme enables organisations to be certified independently for having met a good-practice standard in cyber security and demonstrates to clients (or prospective clients) that you take the protection of their data seriously.\nThe survey reports a rising proportions of medium and large businesses who have achieved the standard - from 4% to 13% of medium businesses and from 10% to 25% of large businesses.\nIn absolute terms the numbers being certified independently are still quite low, but the survey\'s findings show that half of all businesses surveyed (51%) have implemented all of the technical controls under Cyber Essentials, an encouraging sign that the key message of more effective cyber security is reaching business. However, the report states that many organisations, particularly smaller ones, may not be aware that they can gain certification for existing cyber security measures.\nThe survey also highlights that the NCSC’s 10 Steps to Cyber Security, a risk management regime to manage cyber security, has also been successful. Across all businesses, 55% have acted on five or more of the steps. This rises to 94% of large businesses. It also shows that among large charities with an income of £500k per year 85% have implemented five or more of the steps. Micro firms have shown the biggest improvement from 38% in 2016 to 49% in 2018.\nOne key message from the report was the lack of training and staff awareness of cyber security. The report noted that only 20% of businesses and 15% of charities had given their staff any training over the last year. Organisations report that potentially the most disruptive attacks have been flagged up by staff, rather than security measures. This underlines how critical staff awareness and training are in this area, and the 10 Steps guidance has a section on this subject.\nThe NCSC has also produced cyber security guides for small businesses and charities that can significantly reduce an organisation\'s chances of becoming a victim of cyber crime.\nOperation Power OFF\nLast week, the National Crime Agency led a successful joint operation with Dutch Police and other international law enforcement authorities to take down a website advertising Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) services.\nOperation Power OFF saw six suspects arrested for their involvement with the website \'webstresser.org\' and a separate suspect arrested for their suspected involvement in a series of DDoS attacks against the UK finance sector in late 2017.\nWebstresser.org sold the services of a stresser tool that could deliver DDoS attacks. It could be hired to target websites, overwhelm their capability and take them offline, causing widespread disruption to businesses. These services were sold for $14.99 yet could cause hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of damage.\nThis is an excellent example of public and private collaboration to combat cyber crime. With industry engaging with local law enforcement and government agencies and then with international authorities, this cross-border crime can no longer be seen as offering the anonymity it was once believed to hold.\nAnyone who suspects they personally or their business has been the victim of fraud or a cyber crime should report it in the first instance to Action Fraud.\nThe NCSC have published DDoS guidance including advice on readying your defences to deal with a DDoS attack and how to mitigate against one.\nMANRS maketh the network…\nEarly last week malicious actors redirected a portion of internet traffic flowing across Amazon Web Services (AWS) for approximately two hours before stealing around $150,000 in cryptocurrency from MyEtherWallet.com virtual wallets.\nThe attack used a hacking technique where internet traffic is intercepted from a legitimate website and redirected to a fake website (in this case one for MyEtherWallet.com). This allowed the attackers to steal customers\' legitimate logon details in order to empty their cryptocurrency wallets.\nThe attack hijacked the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), a key protocol used for routing internet traffic around the world. The security of the internet as a whole depends on routing security. However, security was never built into BGP, which is decades old.\nThe incident occurred just a day after the non-profit Internet Society (ISOC) announced its Mutually Agreed Norms for Routing Security (MANRS) initiative. They recommend that MANRS should be adopted by internet exchange points (IXPs) and Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who control international internet connectivity.\nWidespread effective management of routing protocols by IXPs and CPS would minimise the most common routing threats to internet traffic and would have reduced the impact of the BGP hijack experienced by MyEtherWallet.com.\nAccording to ISOC, in 2017 alone there were 14,000 routing outages or incidents which led to stolen data, lost revenue, reputational damage and more. ISOC states that MANRS will address these threats through technical and collaborative action across the internet.\nMore information can be found on the MANRS website.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-4th-may-2018
145,145,27th April 2018,"['Cost of ransomware attack on Atlanta\nAs reported in the Weekly Threat Report of 6 April 2018, the US city of Atlanta recently fell victim to an attack by the SamSam ransomware, which exploits a vulnerability in Java servers.\nNew reports indicate the city spent in the region of $2.66m responding to the attack. Costs included incident response, recovery and crisis management, but the city did not pay the ransom demand, reported to be approximately $55,000. There was also a broader cost in terms of the disruption the attack brought to city-wide services, with residents unable to pay bills and parking tickets as the city’s self-service portal was taken offline.\nThis case highlights the costs to organisations of ransomware attacks. However, paying a ransom does not guarantee that data will be returned and access to files restored. Nor does paying a ransom prevent a future attack; indeed, it may encourage further attacks.\nInvestment in cyber security can reduce the likelihood of malware infection and prevent the need for costly clean-up operations.\nThe NCSC has issued guidance on mitigating ransomware and other forms of malware.\nIran and India ban cryptocurrencies\nIran’s central bank has banned Iranian banks, credit institutions and currency exchanges from selling or purchasing digital currencies. It says cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, are used in money-laundering and financing terrorism, and that they are inherently unreliable and risky.\nThe same concerns are expressed widely around the world, including by the Chief of the International Monetary Fund, but many also believe digital currencies and the technology behind them could have a positive effect as a low-cost payment method.\nIran’s actions follow similar decisions by other central banks, such as the Reserve Bank of India’s decision in April to serve three months’ notice for entities they regulate to cease dealing in digital currencies.\nThe central bank decisions have been concerning for digital currency users in these countries (reportedly around five million in India), but it is too early to say whether these actions will last, have any long-term impact on the wider cryptocurrency market or whether other countries will follow suit.\nSome countries are debating the regulation of digital currencies: Japan has recently created a regulatory body for its cryptocurrency exchanges, for example, and others have considered creating their own state-backed digital currencies.\nThe future of digital currencies is still unknown, which is a major contributing factor to their price volatility, but they are likely to be with us for the foreseeable future.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-27th-april-2018
146,146,20th April 2018,"[""Cyber criminal groups identified on social media\nLast week Facebook deleted around 120 private discussion groups - equating to more than 300,000 members - that were promoting a host of illicit cyber criminal activities, including spamming, selling stolen debit and credit account credentials, phony tax refunds, DDoS-for-hire services and botnet creation tools.\nThe groups had reportedly been operating on Facebook for an average of two years, although some had been in operation for up to nine years. The deletions were a result of analysis work carried out by a cyber security researcher using common terminology for this type of activity and it is likely that there are many more sites of this nature on Facebook and other social media platforms.\nThe use of social media to advertise illicit goods and services is perhaps not as well reported as the use of darknet criminal marketplaces (such as Alphabay and Hansa that were taken down by law enforcement last year) but it is of no surprise that criminals will seek to utilise whatever means available to peddle their wares.\nFrom past experience, Facebook’s deletion of these groups is unlikely to have a long term impact, as the activity will likely be displaced elsewhere, or the groups will use names that are less obviously associated with cyber crime, to make their detection more difficult.\nAirline database hacked by disgruntled former employee\nA former employee at the Alaskan airline PenAir hacked her previous employer’s flight reservation system in an apparent retaliation for being fired.\nBefore leaving the company the individual created a fictitious user profile with escalated privileges to enable future system access. She then used this fictitious account to block other users’ access and to delete critical data.\nIn a second attack she also deleted seat maps used to allocate passenger seats. PenAir realised their data had been disrupted and worked through the night so that service was resumed by the morning with no impact to customers.\nIdentified following an FBI investigation, the individual pleaded guilty to the charges against her and was charged with carrying out fraud in ‘connection to computers’.\nUser privileges should always be managed and reviewed regularly. The principle of ‘least privilege’ should be followed. The NCSC has released guidance for managing user privileges as part of our 10 steps to Cyber Security: 10 Steps: Managing User Privileges.\nThai mobile operator in reported data breach due to poor cloud security\nTrueMove H, a major mobile operator in Thailand, suffered a data breach involving the personal data of around 46,000 customers, including images of identity documents such as driving licences and passports.\nA security researcher uncovered the breach using open source tools to scan for publicly accessible information on misconfigured Amazon Web Service Simple Storage Service (AWS S3) buckets, a popular cloud storage solution. The researcher claimed there was no security protection for the files and therefore all he needed to gain access to the data was the URL.\nThe default setting for S3 buckets is 'private'. AWS best practice is to never open access to the public and to control access to S3 resources using a combination of Access Control Lists (ACLs) and bucket policies.\nThe NCSC advises that anyone seeking to exploit the benefits of cloud storage solutions should ensure that the security of the data is a prime consideration.\nIf you're using or considering using Cloud technology, we recommend reading the NCSC's Cloud Security Collection and Implementing the Cloud Security Principles.\nAttacker dwell time on victim networks still too long\nSecurity company Mandiant's latest M-Trends report has revealed there are, on average, 101 days between an attacker compromising a system and the victim detecting the compromise, with this increasing to 175 days for companies in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.\nWhile this is a decrease from 416 days in 2011 , the current dwell time means attackers still have ample time to achieve their goal.\nAttackers are always developing new and improved ways of committing network intrusions, leading to data breaches, but often they are looking for the most simple weaknesses in our defences. Following basic cyber security good practice can prove effective in preventing such breaches from happening.\nThe NCSC’s Cyber Essentials scheme provides relevant advice to help improve network security, alongside 10 Steps to Cyber Security.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

149,149,23rd March 2018,"[""Money laundering valued at up to $200 billion through cryptocurrencies\nA joint report between Surrey University and researchers at security vendor Bromium estimates that the proceeds of cyber crime make up to 8-10% of total illegal profits laundered globally, believed to be valued at up to $200 billion.\nThe report surmises that virtual currencies such as Bitcoin are becoming the primary tool used by criminals to launder proceeds. While Bitcoin has long been viewed as the criminal’s choice for cryptocurrency, they have been seen moving to other virtual currencies appearing to offer greater anonymity, including Monero and Zcash.\nThe purchasing of digital items within computer games is also being used to launder profits, offering many different platforms for exchanging funds. Digital payment systems add an extra layer of complexity for law enforcement to unravel.\nNational Lottery in “credential stuffing” attack\nOn the 16th of March, The National Lottery advised its 10.5 million account holders to change their passwords after reporting they had been the subject of a ‘credential stuffing’ cyber attack.\nCamelot UK Lotteries confirmed that approximately 150 accounts suffered an unauthorised login, although fewer than ten had actual unauthorised activity within the account. Camelot has reported that no customer has suffered any financial loss.\nCredential stuffing is where previously stolen username (often an email address) and password combinations are used to attempt account logins on other websites. This relies on users’ poor cyber security practices - in this case the re-use of the same username or email address and password combinations across multiple sites.\nCyber criminals employ automated tools to attempt these logins in the hope that a successful login is achieved. Internet provider Akamai estimate that almost half (43%) of the 17 billion login attempts they tracked in a two-month period in 2017 were fraudulent in nature.\n\nIn this instance, due to the type of data involved, the NCSC’s advice for National Lottery customers with online accounts is to follow Camelot’s advice and reset the password on any service where you’ve used a similar password.\nThe NCSC previously published password guidance, which individuals and organisations can use to help keep their online accounts secure.\nIf you are generally concerned, you can look on services like haveibeenpwned.com to see if your username or email address has been involved in a breach.\nUsers should always enable two-factor authentication (also known as two-step authentication or two-step login) where services support it.\nEven if you are not a Camelot customer but have used a service that’s previously reported a data breach, you should reset the password on every service where you’ve used a similar password.\nPhishing emails deemed number one threat by UK Businesses\nIndustry research by security company Clearswift has reported that malicious links within emails are perceived as posing the biggest cyber threat to UK businesses, with 59% of business decision makers highlighting this as their chief concern.

For a month last summer, Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) attackers are reported to have maliciously modified versions of CCleaner and CCleaner Cloud at source, before being downloaded by 2.27 million customers worldwide. The attackers then selected a small number of high profile technology and telecommunications companies to receive a secondary payload.\nAvast’s ongoing investigation has now revealed that CCleaner developer Piriform (acquired by Avast in July) was probably compromised as early as March 2017, although no information is given about the original attack vector.\nThe investigation also points to a possible third stage of the malware that may have been distributed via the CCleaner attack: once on the Piriform network, the attackers deployed a tool known as Shadowpad, which included keylogging and password stealing functionality, as well as other tools, to allow them to progress their attack remotely. The same tool may have been deployed to those customers who received the secondary payload.\nAvast also details the steps it has taken to remove the threat from the Piriform network.\nRansomware re-infects Colorado Department of Transportation IT system\nWe previously reported on SamSam (or Samas) ransomware infecting Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) computers.

A peak of 1.7 Terabits per second (Tbps) was recorded, although the attack was mitigated. This followed a recent attack against GitHub on 28 February, with a peak of 1.35 Tbps. The largest known attack previously took place in 2016 against the US DNS provider DYN, which peaked at 1.2 Tbps.\nThe method used for these attacks is known as a ‘memcached server DDoS’. Memcached servers store data in memory that applications may need access to on external databases. Large companies often use memcached servers to help speed up and assist in dealing with large demands on their services. When memcached servers are openly accessible over the internet via User Data Protocol (UDP), they can be utilised to significantly amplify data.\nThe attackers ‘ping’ a server with a small packet of data in order that memcached servers reply with a response to the victim which is up to fifty thousand times the original packet size. If there are no mitigations such as filtering or management of networks, this could easily cause a service to go offline. Whilst the vectors were different in the 2016 DYN attack, the incident demonstrates the potential ramifications if other services are dependent on the targeted service; for more information, see the NCSC Weekly Threat Report 24 October 2016.\nIn the attack against GitHub, there has since been reporting of a ransom made in the data payload, demanding a payment of 50 Monero (worth approx. $15 000). There are also suspicions among various mitigation service providers that this method of amplification has now been adopted by DDoS-as-a-Service providers.\nThese latest DDoS attacks were mitigated, but further attacks may occur.

CDOT is responsible for managing and maintaining roads as well as monitoring traffic in the US state of Colorado, but no critical operational IT systems are believed to have been affected.\nThe organisation has taken 2,000 computers offline as a precaution to isolate those infected and prevent the malware spreading. Employees are making use of personal devices as well as cloud services to continue to work, although reports suggest that some processes, such as contract bids/tendering and payment of employee wages, are being delayed. CDOT have stated that they do not intend to pay the ransom and that data can be recovered using backups.\nIt remains unclear how CDOT’s systems became infected, although the malware involved is believed to be a variant of the SamSam (or Samas) ransomware. This ransomware has previously affected the education and healthcare sectors in the US, with an Indiana hospital recently paying $55,000 in Bitcoin to get their files back. We are unaware of any UK organisations being affected by SamSam. However, these cases highlight the importance of having adequate measures in place to mitigate against the risks associated with such malware infections.\nNCSC has published new guidance on how organisations and home users can reduce the likelihood of malware infection: /guidance/mitigating-malware\nReports of increased use of Counterfeit Code-Signing Certificates\nA recent open source blog post from Insikt suggests there is a small but growing market in counterfeit code-signing certificates. This raises further questions regarding the effectiveness of code-signing certificates in providing assurance to website users by establishing the identity of software authors and confirming that the software has not been corrupted or altered since its original distribution.\nThe Weekly Threat Report of 15th December 2017, highlighted that websites using SSL and HTTPS, signified by the padlock, are not inherently protected from attack. Malevolent actors can potentially compromise sites using HTTPS domains or obtain legitimate certificates for use on malicious websites.\nCounterfeit certificates were first identified in 2015. They are advertised as being registered under legitimate corporations and supplied by known issuers. The early versions were expensive at approximately $1,000 but more recent standard certificates have been found for sale at $295.\nThe main benefit for malicious actors of the counterfeit certificates is that the certificates are highly effective in remaining undetected by antivirus software. However, as these certificates are thought to be created for each buyer individually, it seems likely that, at present, the majority of cyber criminals won’t use this technique.\nSmartphone malware on the increase\nCyber security company Trend Micro issued its annual Mobile Threat Landscape report last month. The number of unique mobile malware samples detected by the company increased by 415% from 2016 to 2017.\nPreviously, identified threats had mostly affected Android users downloading mobile apps from unofficial third-party stores but, according to the report, for the first time Google’s official mobile app store, Google Play, was significantly affected too.\nRansomware and banking malware were the major threats and are likely to pose a growing problem in 2018, according to the report. Mobile ransomware detections were highest in China, followed by Indonesia, India and Japan, with banking malware detections highest in Indonesia and India.\nSymantec also reported this month that it had found eight apps infected with the Sockbot malware on Google Play. The malware can add compromised devices to a botnet and potentially perform DDoS attacks. Symantec’s estimate of potential victims ranges from 600,000 to 2.6 million devices with US users appearing to be the main target.\nApple was also affected and, although it exerts more control over apps added to its app store, Trend Micro report that many applications infected with adware and other unwanted functionality found their way to the company's app store.\nOn a more positive note, the clear majority of mobile ransomware that Trend Micro spotted last year was not as capable as desktop versions of the malware and less than 1% of it ended up infecting end user devices. Nevertheless, the increased threat is leading to a stronger approach to mobile security including initiatives on mobile vulnerability research and proactive coordination between vendors and platforms. According to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) committee, Google is also working on two built-in features for the next version of its operating system, Android P, to protect users from malicious apps spying on them using their smartphones’ camera or microphone.\nJoin CiSP""]",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-2nd-march-2018
153,153,23rd February 2018,"['Cloud security - FedEx data leak from AW\nAdoption of cloud computing (the process of providing applications, processing power and storage through remote servers over the internet) is increasing amongst medium and large organisations. However, as cloud is adopted, the securing of services in the cloud as well as the security claims of the cloud provider become mission critical priorities for both private and public-sector enterprises.\nMedia reports that scanned documents containing the identity details of up to 120,000 people have been freely available on a misconfigured Amazon Web Services, Simple Storage Service (AWS S3) server used by the shipping company FedEx. Cloud storage providers have previously been associated with a large scale data breach at Verizon.\nWhere cloud storage services are breached the ultimate reason almost always appears to be poor security configuration. Ensuring that good security practices are followed by all users and providers of cloud services would, therefore, prevent most breaches. The NCSC has published guidance available here.\nFormer employee jailed for intentionally damaging computer network\nA disgruntled former Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) employee was sentenced last week to a year in prison for intentionally causing damage to CPR’s computer network. It is unclear whether train services were affected, but the incident is reported to have cost the organisation approximately $30,000.\nIn December 2015, the employee resigned from CPR after being informed that he would be fired for insubordinate behaviour. However, before returning his laptop and remote access authentication token to the organisation, the disgruntled individual accessed CPR’s core computer network switches, through which critical data flows. He strategically deleted files, removed admin accounts or changed their passwords, returning the laptop after wiping its hard drive of any evidence of his actions. This meant IT staff were unable to access the switches, forcing them to reboot the network, causing a system outage. Forensic investigations of systems allowed the damage to be traced back to the individual concerned.\nThis case is a good example of how disgruntled, former employees can pose a cyber threat to organisations. Such insider threats are not unique to the rail sector. Public and private organisations in every sector need to be vigilant to such threats. It highlights the importance of ensuring IT privileges and account access is suspended when a staff member’s employment is due to be terminated, preventing malicious cyber activity from being conducted.\nIndia City Union Bank SWIFT Related Attack\nIn the last week, the Russian Central Bank reported that an undisclosed Russian bank was targeted in late 2017 in a SWIFT related cyber attack. Since then, India City Union Bank reported that they had suffered a SWIFT fraud style incident over the weekend. Some local reporting suggested that insider activity led to the heist, however this has been denied by India City Union Bank. They stated that they had been attacked by “international cyber-criminals and there is no evidence of internal staff involvement”.\nIn these types of attacks the local infrastructure is targeted and compromised, with local valid operator credentials being used to access the SWIFT system. The attackers then submit fraudulent payment messages. The SWIFT system itself is not breached. SWIFT increased its security measures in 2017, but this particular attack methodology remains lucrative.\nIn the case of India City Union Bank, $2 million dollars were fraudulently taken, and funds transferred to Dubai, Turkey and China. India City Union Bank were able to block some payments but are said to be working to recoup a missing $1 million. It is notable that some recent victims may have a better security posture than previous victims of SWIFT fraud. It is possible that increasing sophistication by threat actors is enabling them to target a broader range of organisations, and or, they are exploiting the possibility of the insider threat.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

The only possible effect on users’ machines was reduced performance.\nThe NCSC then followed up with guidance detailing how a compromised third party JavaScript library called Browsealoud had caused visitors to websites with the library embedded inadvertently to run mining code for the attackers. This would have caused no effect other than using up the device’s CPU power. The compromise was mitigated easily by Browsealoud being taken offline by their administrators.\nFor more on cryptocurrency mining, see last week’s NCSC Threat Report (published 9 February 2018).\nDomain name hijacking on managed services provider\nDomain hijacking is a form of theft where the attacker takes control of a domain name without the consent of the original registrant. Hijacking can happen because of security flaws or due to the domain name’s rental period expiring. Last week, a major US managed services provider had three of its domain names hijacked, shutting off email and websites for many of the company’s clients. The company hosts more than 100,000 websites and 40,000 managed technology accounts, mostly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).\nAfter taking control of the domain names, the hacker replaced the customer login page with a web chat service. Customers were then tricked into chatting to the perpetrator instead of being able to access their control panel.\nAssessment\nDomain hijacking has been a problem for many years, but this is likely to be one of the largest in terms of scale of websites potentially affected. However, it is highly unlikely that this particular domain hijacking significantly affected UK organisations. It is currently unknown how the domain names were hijacked but it is likely the domains simply expired, allowing the hackers to re-register them.\nDomain hijacking could potentially have significant negative implications for any company/organisation that has a web presence. Attackers could replace a company’s website, or web application, with an identical replica site designed to trick visitors into entering login credentials or personal information, thereby potentially helping to facilitate fraud. Malicious software could also be uploaded onto visitors’ computers. If a hijacked domain had been whitelisted by other businesses, that trust would be extended to the attacker. Such actions would almost certainly cause significant reputational as well as financial damage to affected organisations. Managed service providers are likely to be a higher priority target of domain hijacking due to the potential access and damage they could cause to their clients.\nOrganisations can protect themselves against domain hijacking in several ways, including:\nLocking the domain using a web service to guard against unauthorised domain transfers\nEnsuring all of domain name contacts have valid contact information\nSetting the domain to auto-renew each year\nCryptocurrencies on the Darknet\nAccording to the threat intelligence company Recorded Future, cryptocurrencies such as Litecoin and Dash are threatening to replace Bitcoin as the most used payment methods in online criminal marketplaces. This appears to be driven by relatively high Bitcoin payment fees, especially for smaller transactions, and delays in completing purchases due to the adopted three confirmations rule. This rule, to combat double-spending abuse, sees most vendors on the Darknet require three published confirmations to the blockchain before treating transactions as complete.\nThe researchers say that the prospect of waiting up to 24 hours to confirm some transactions, coupled with payment fees that could amount to 30% of the transaction value, is rendering Bitcoin unattractive for a large number of cyber criminals. The technology behind Litecoin is very similar to Bitcoin but it allows for faster transactions and significantly lower commission fees, resulting in an increasing number of vendors accepting it and other easier-to-use cryptocurrencies as payment.\nRecorded Future expect the cryptocurrency diversification trend to intensify and suggest that Bitcoin might lose its dominant position among payment methods on the Darknet in the next six to twelve months, although it is still likely to remain one of the main payment instruments. More widely, legitimate users of cryptocurrencies are likely to take the same factors into account, and cryptocurrencies that are the quickest, easiest and cheapest to use are most likely to succeed.\nFCA and ICO publish joint update on GDPR\nDesigned to improve the security of personal data, the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will apply to all organisations that process personal data, including the financial services industry, from 25 May 2018. Some organisations are already required to notify the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO), and possibly some other bodies, when they suffer a breach of personal data. The GDPR introduces a duty on all organisations to report certain types of data breach to the ICO and, in some cases, to individuals. Organisations will have to notify the ICO of a breach where it is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals. Failure to report a breach when required to do so could result in a significant fine of up to 2% of an organisation’s annual turnover, or €10 million, as well as a fine for the breach itself.\nFollowing feedback from industry, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has published a joint update with the ICO (with whom they have been closely working in preparation for GDPR). This update reassures firms that the GDPR does not impose requirements that are incompatible with the FCA handbook and highlights that, in fact, many of these GDPR requirements are directly compatible with the FCA handbook itself. They also re-emphasise that compliance with GDPR is a board-level responsibility and that they must be able to demonstrate the actions they have taken to ensure compliance.\nThis update follows a report last month from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) urging organisations to prepare as, worryingly, DCMS data showed that fewer than half of all businesses and charities were even aware of GDPR.\nJoin CiSP""]",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-16th-february-2018

Security researchers are reporting they have seen over 140 malware samples based on the proof of concept code. Whilst there have not been instances of Meltdown and Spectre actually being leveraged to compromise a system, it is a timely reminder that miscreants will take published security vulnerabilities and weaponise them into malware quickly, making it all the more important to patch.\nAs previously reported by the NCSC, Meltdown and Spectre are two related, side-channel attacks against modern microprocessors that can result in the unprivileged code reading data it should not be able to access. Most devices may be vulnerable to some extent with many vendors releasing patches to secure systems.\nThe NCSC have previously advised users and business enterprise users to follow vendor advice and apply patches. For more detailed advice regarding these vulnerabilities, please see the latest guidance from the NCSC.\nCryptomining trends\nNews articles have focused recently on the value and volatility of cryptocurrencies, over the past year, most notably Bitcoin which had a peak value of $20,089.00 in December 2017. Cryptocurrencies can be earned, or ‘mined’, by performing computationally intensive operations to support the running of the currency. Malware intended to mine cryptocurrencies on victim computers has been available since at least 2013 and surged in popularity in late 2017 as the currencies’ value increased.\nCryptomining malware is attractive to cyber criminals as they are able to use botnets of compromised machines as miners without having to cover the infrastructure costs (e.g. the cost of electricity would be covered by the victim). Despite the potentially lucrative rewards, cryptomining is becoming increasing economically unviable for some legitimate users as the running costs (hardware and associated electricity costs) often outweigh any potential gains in this increasingly competitive environment. This has also had real world implications on the price and availability of graphic cards as many are now being purchased specifically for cryptomining.\nFor cyber criminals, cryptomining malware has some advantages over ransomware. It doesn’t rely on the victim being willing and/or capable of making payment. It is also not confrontational but is designed to operate undetected in the background over a long period, potentially earning more money than a ransomware campaign.\nMore importantly, it can be distributed through same delivery mechanisms as ransomware (e.g. exploit kits) and, once established, a network of mining bots can generate a respectable amount of money with minimal effort (e.g. the Smominru botnet generates 24 XMR per day (approximately £8,500)). Monero is the preferred currency as the processing power required to mine it is minimal compared to that required to mine Bitcoin.\nIt is highly likely that the criminal deployment of cryptomining malware will increase during 2018 as cyber criminals either shift their focus away from other forms of malware or run these campaigns alongside their established cyber criminal activities.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

Coincheck is Japan’s largest Bitcoin exchange and deals with various other cryptocurrencies.\nCoincheck have reassured customers that they would reimburse any losses. They are reporting that at present the attack methods deployed by the hackers are unknown and that the NEM had been stored in a ‘hot wallet’. Hot wallets are connected to the internet and are therefore vulnerable to cyber criminals, whereas cold wallets are small devices that hold your sum of cryptocurrency and are not connected to the internet. Some people even keep them locked in safes.\nThis heist highlights the security issues surrounding storing cryptocurrency in online exchanges, which can be vulnerable to attack rather than a hardware-based solution or personal wallet.\nThe UK also saw its first reported case of a physical robbery-related to Bitcoin, whereby armed masked men burst into the home of a cryptocurrency trader in Moulsford, Oxfordshire. The intruders threatened violence if he didn’t transfer funds to a Bitcoin wallet. Whilst the amount transferred is unknown or even confirmed as successful, it is another instance of the security issues surrounding cryptocurrencies and their perceived lack of danger.

It was reportedly first seen in early January 2018, initially disappearing but resurfacing days later having been through further development. It then spread rapidly to infect more than 30,000 IoT devices.\nHNS reportedly uses custom-built peer-to-peer communication to spread to new targets and uses the same exploit as the Reaper botnet, identified in September 2017. While previous IoT botnets have had DDoS functionality, including the Mirai botnet used to carry out significant DDoS attacks, HNS is currently believed to lack this component. However, it reportedly has the capability to carry out data exfiltration, code execution and interference with a device’s operation.\nThe use of custom-built decentralised architecture, along with a possible focus on espionage capabilities, represent an evolution in IoT botnets. HNS has reportedly undergone constant redevelopment, indicating the level of effort the threat actors are willing to invest in it. As with other botnets, HNS does not currently achieve persistence, and rebooting a compromised device should return it to a clean state. However, it could easily be reinfected by the same route. Changing default passwords for IoT devices is an effective mitigation against some attacks, and is one of the tips included in our password guidance.\nEnsuring your devices are fully patched and limiting access to these devices will also help protect against compromise.

Known as a ‘jackpotting’ attack, the hackers are believed to swap the ATM hard drive with one infected with malware, giving attackers full control of the ATM and its contents. At least six machines in the US are believed to have been targeted in this way this month.\nThe individual targeting of ATMs through physical injection of malware is a relatively common attack methodology. A number of cases have previously been reported in Malaysia, Russia, Ukraine and Mexico. There has been at least one reported case of a physical injection ATM malware incident in the UK to date.\nIt is unclear whether the specific methodology used against US ATMs could be used to target machines in other countries including the UK, but the attack relies on criminals gaining physical access to the machine’s hard drive. The implementation of additional controls, such as enhancement to ATM physical security and patching machine software reduces the likelihood of a successful attack.\nWe have previously reported on criminals conducting ‘jackpotting’ attacks against ATMs. For more information on the malware threat to UK ATMs, log in to the Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) to view our report on this issue.

The user has to provide standard login details of a password and username and also something that only that user has access to. This might be a physical token, keyfob device, fingerprint, facial recognition or SMS confirmation via mobile phone.\nWhen asked why 2FA is not mandatory, the Google software engineer raised the issue of usability and suggested users would potentially choose an alternative service if they were forced to use additional security.\n2FA is also not mandatory for users of Uber but it is offered when suspicious activity is detected on an account. However, a security researcher is also reported to have found a bug in Uber’s 2FA system that allowed hackers to bypass the authentication system without entering a relevant code.\nIncreased attention in attacks against 2FA systems (e.g. SMS interception for high value bitcoin users) and its usability could degrade how it is perceived and trusted in the long term, which could result in a lower uptake of the service. As one of the core methods of securing online accounts it is important that users trust 2FA and find it relatively user-friendly.\nUsing 2FA makes the compromise of online accounts much more difficult than using just passwords and can be very effective against guessed or compromised passwords, which was behind the success of the recent targeting of the UK Parliament. The NCSC highly recommends the use of 2FA.

Meanwhile, malware on the petrol stations’ computer systems was used to display false data on the amount of fuel dispensed to customers, with each customer unknowingly receiving between 3% and 7% less fuel than they paid for. The stolen fuel was then sold separately and off the books by the criminals who pocketed the profits.\nThe malware used was reportedly ‘nearly impossible to detect’, though Russian authorities recently disrupted the scam when they arrested the alleged creator of the malware, Denis Sayev.\nIt’s not clear if a scam like this would be feasible in the UK. The National Measurement and Regulation Office enforces regulation of devices used in UK industry for measuring volumes of purchased commodity, that would make this sort of crime difficult, but not impossible, to execute.\nThis attack represents an evolution of previously known attacks on payment systems, which have directly targeted the payment card data itself.

By advertising on known criminal forums and discussing their use, it was shown that Esteves knew that they were being exploited by criminals. As a result of this operation, these services have been taken down.\nIn 2015, the NCA and Trend Micro signed a Memorandum of Understanding to work with each other to help tackle cyber crime. This cooperation extends beyond this operation and illustrates the key role that industry has in tackling, what can be, a highly technical criminal threat.\nThe NCSC is committed to working closely with industry in order to help us achieve a greater understanding of the cyber security environment. The government’s forthcoming flagship cyber security event - CyberUK 2018 - will bring together over 2,000 cyber security leaders and professionals across the UK, including representatives from both government and industry.\nTyposquatting is still big business\nTyposquatting (also known as cybersquatting or url hijacking) is the deliberate act of registering misspelt popular website domains, to capitalise on internet users accidently typing incorrect characters for a website address into the address bar of a web browser.\nInstead of visiting the correct website, users will be taken to an alternative website intended for a variety of malicious purposes, including the theft of personal information, fraud and the installation of malicious software.\nA recent study by cyber security company Sophos found that typosquatting is still a huge industry and there are a significant number of fake domains registered, including sites targeting users of popular websites such as Google, Facebook, Twitter, Microsoft and Apple. Specifically, it was found that 80% of all possible one-character variants of Facebook, Google, and Apple website domains are registered.\nThe issue of typosquatting is not new but can seriously impact individual users as well as businesses, organisations and government websites across the globe.\nAlthough there are solutions including the legitimate purchase of common misspelt domains as part of brand protection, this could amount to hundreds of possible domain name variants which might not be practical or cost effective, particularly for small businesses.\nIndividual users are advised to double check their url spellings before accessing a website. It is also advisable to bookmark favourite websites and, if in doubt, check url spellings in a popular search engine to make sure they are correct.\nNetflix “brandjacking” highlights increasing sophistication of phishing campaigns\nA “brandjacking” phishing campaign aimed at Netflix subscribers was identified by cyber security experts in recent weeks.\nThe campaign utilised multiple phishing techniques. Subscribers received emails requesting that login details and credit card data be updated via a portal. Once the details were entered the subscriber was shown a fake verified by VISA page and then redirected to the real Netflix login page. The Greek letter chi was used in place of the ‘x’ in Netflix in some emails to subscribers, but otherwise the branding and style of the emails and portal appeared authentic.\nPhishing campaigns are becoming increasingly sophisticated. An open source report found cyber criminals are hacking into sites with a valid website security certificate and replacing the content with the site they are seeking to imitate.\nThere are a number of email anti-spoofing measures outlined on the NCSC website that can help prevent phishing email attacks from reaching users in the first place.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

The phishing emails were written in the Korean language and purported to be from the South Korean National Counter Terrorism Centre, and coincided with drills being carried out in preparation for the Games. They contained a malicious Word document that, if opened, would run a hidden PowerShell script, enabling the attackers to execute commands and install further malware. The objectives of the campaign are unclear, but could include gaining access to data for financial gain, extortion, or gathering intelligence on the planning around the Games.\nIn addition to this specific campaign targeting organisations associated with the Games, events such as these are often used by cyber criminals and other cyber actors as a basis for phishing or social engineering attacks against the public. The NCSC has recently provided guidance on avoiding phishing attacks.\nUndisclosed cryptocurrency mining software reported on apps downloaded from third-party app store\nAs noted in the NCSC Weekly Threat Report of 29 September 2017, CPU-based cryptocurrency-mining malware significantly increased in 2017. A recent open source report suggested that hundreds of malicious Android apps containing a hidden Coinhive cryptocurrency miner were available for download on the third-party app store, androidapk.world.\nCoinhive uses website visitors' CPU resources to mine the cryptocurrency Monero, providing website owners with a legitimate alternative to advertising for monetising their websites. In October 2017, Coinhive acknowledged they had underestimated the extent of service misuse and launched a new version, AuthoredMine, with an opt-in screen which asked users for permission to borrow their computing power. Nevertheless, the original version of the service is still reportedly in circulation.\nCryptocurrencies rely on ‘miners’ to carry out a large number of calculations to verify transactions. In exchange for contributing computing power, miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency. A miner running in the background can significantly reduce the performance and battery life of a computer or device, and cause it to overheat.\nThe NCSC recommends that users only install apps from the official application store for their device. Malicious apps in official stores are more likely to be detected and subsequently removed from the store or device.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

160,160,5th January 2018,"[""'Meltdown' and 'Spectre' vulnerabilities to microprocessors\nReports of new security flaws affecting microprocessors called ‘Meltdown’ and ‘Spectre’ surfaced this week. Processors in most devices employ a range of techniques to speed up their operation, and the vulnerabilities allow some of these techniques to be abused to obtain information about areas of memory not normally visible to an attacker. As a result, normally difficult actions - such as recovering passwords - are theoretically made easier.\nHowever, an attacker would still need to run code on a device. Access would typically be gained via well-known means, such as phishing attacks or browsing malicious websites. At this stage there has been no evidence of any malicious exploitation and patches are being produced for the major platforms. The NCSC has pro-actively advised that all organisations and home users continue to protect their systems from threats by installing patches as soon as they become available, and has recommended that home users enable automatic updates so future security measures are installed.\nFurther advice for enterprise administrators and home users can be found on this website.\nCyber-enabled fraud: an increasing threat for 2018\nMedia reporting highlights an alleged attempt by hackers to steal funds from Russian bank Globex. The hackers appear to have used legitimate credentials to access the SWIFT international payment system to attempt fraudulent wire transfer requests valued at 55 million roubles (c. £700,000).\nThis attempted theft highlights that poor end user security is still a problem for some global financial institutions.\nIncreasingly, cyber thieves are attempting to harvest legitimate login credentials, and then commit fraudulent activity using the accesses that these legitimate credentials provide. Most notoriously, around US $81 million was stolen from Bangladesh Bank in February 2016.\nAnalysis of the Bangladesh Bank theft indicates that the hackers responsible likely implanted malware into the banks servers to steal legitimate SWIFT credentials, which were then used to conduct the fraudulent transactions.\nMost organisations in the UK finance sector will have sufficient cyber security measures in place to protect against the type of fraud which occurred against the Bangladesh and Globex banks, however, globally, this trend of cyber-enabled fraud, which seeks to acquire and then abuse legitimate credentials, is likely to continue throughout 2018, and it is likely to be attempted against UK organisations across all sectors.\nCyber attack forces US hospital offline\nThe Jones Memorial Hospital in the US state of New York was hit by a cyber attack this week impacting some of its information services. The hospital stated that they used standard computer downtime procedures in response, and they believe no patients’ financial or medical information has been compromised.\nThe exact cause of the incident was not revealed, although similarities can be drawn to previous ransomware attacks against healthcare providers in the US. While all sectors are vulnerable to such attacks, healthcare organisations in the US are more likely to be specifically targeted by cyber criminals because they operate privately, for profit and have a high reliance on access to data. As a result, these organisations also tend to have appropriate response and backup procedures in place, enabling them to limit the operational and financial impact of cyber attacks.\nThe NCSC has published guidance on how to prevent a ransomware incident and what to do if your organisation is infected.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

161,161,22nd December 2017,"[""Ransomware fears cause companies to hoard Bitcoin\nCompanies are reportedly stockpiling cryptocurrencies to hedge against the possible need to pay off cyber criminals. Some firms are said to be investing in Bitcoin and Ethereum to ensure that they have cryptocurrency funds available if they are affected by a ransomware attack. A survey carried out earlier this year by Citrix found that 42% of companies surveyed were building cryptocurrency stockpiles for ransomware payments, with 28% holding more than 30 bitcoins. The cost of paying ransoms is increasing rapidly along with the value of the cryptocurrencies in which they are paid, so by investing now, some companies hope to ensure that the cost of a ransom is less pricey than it might be later.\nHowever, this approach comes with its own risks, as such holdings may themselves be targeted. With a single bitcoin now worth over $17,000 (£12,000), a company’s cryptocurrency wallet can be worth a substantial amount to a cyber criminal.\nThe NCSC’s website provides further advice to organisations that may be affected by ransomware. The NCSC does not offer advice on whether or not companies should invest in Bitcoin. While it is a matter for the victim whether or not to pay a ransom, the National Crime Agency encourages industry and the public not to do so.\nDaesh cyber threats fail to materialise\nPro-Daesh hacking group “Caliphate Cyber Ghosts” recently threatened to hack US government and corporate websites, declaring electronic war against those countries fighting against the terrorist group. They have subsequently claimed to have successfully hacked the sensitive sites of the US Army, the Interior Ministry, the State Department and other government websites. They also claim to have breached sites such as the Geological Society of Nevada and legal website ‘Divorce Store’.\nHowever, there has been no evidence of hacking of sensitive government data. This follows the general trend over the last year of a number of pro-Daesh cyber groups who have threatened to conduct cyber attacks to no real effect.\nNew Android malware can melt mobile phones\nA newly discovered family of Android malware can put so much load on mobile phones that it can cause physical damage, according to cyber security researchers.\nThe Loapi family of Android Trojans has been described as a “jack of all trades” for its wide variety of functionality, ranging from participating in distributed denial of service attacks to signing the user up to paid subscription services. It also includes a module that mines the cryptocurrency Monero by using the phone to generate new coins for the malware’s authors. These activities put so much demand on the phone’s CPU that it generates considerable heat, which the researchers found caused the battery in their test phone to bulge and deform the cover after two days of activity.\nLoapi is being distributed via advertising campaigns which mimic genuine antivirus products and adult websites. It repeatedly asks the user for device administrator permissions and, once installed, seeks to delete antivirus software already on the device. It can then carry out a range of malicious functions.\nThe NCSC recommends in its guidance that enterprise-managed devices are configured to only run apps that have been added to a whitelist (hence blocking other malicious apps). Where this approach is not feasible, users should only install apps from a device’s built-in store such as Google Play.\nZeus Panda (Panda Banker) Targeting Festive Shoppers\nShoppers are being reminded to be careful when purchasing goods online following a recent code update for Zeus Panda (aka Panda Banker) malware. In time for the festive season, the code update included a newly configured hit list targeting high street shops online as well as travel and online streaming sites – all intended to reflect the festive holiday shopping and habits of users.\nThe malicious code is injected into the websites and is designed to steal login credentials such as name, address, date of birth, mother’s maiden name, credit card information and mobile telephone number. Zeus Panda previously targeted the financial sector and has seen a relatively quiet 2017. As it is sold as a commercial malware, Zeus Panda is used by many criminal groups, and no particular group has been identified as being responsible for its use. Different variants of the malware over the past two years have been used to target payment systems, banks, airlines and online gaming sites. The NCSC would remind users of the importance of keeping antivirus services up to date, following safety warnings if shown by the web browser, and avoiding clicking on unknown links in unsolicited emails.\nWannacry attributed to North Korea\nMedia outlets reported the US attribution of the “WannaCry” cyber attack to North Korea. Writing in the Wall Street Journal, Homeland security adviser Tom Bossert stated:\n“The attack was widespread and cost billions, and North Korea is directly responsible. We do not make this allegation lightly. It is based on evidence. We are not alone with our findings, either. Other governments and private companies agree.”\nMr Bossert’s assertions were followed up with a statement from UK Foreign Office Minister Lord Ahmad who said:\n“Britain's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) assesses it is highly likely that North Korea's Lazarus hacking group were behind the WannaCry campaign.”\nThe NCSC started investigating a potential DPRK link on Friday 12 May and, within a week, had identified malware code overlaps linking the incident to Lazarus Group. The NCSC led the technical investigation into the WannaCry attack and published guidance on its website to help organisations and home users mitigate the impact of the incident..\nNCSC advice and guidance can be seen here.\nLord Ahmad’s full statement can be seen here.""]",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-22nd-december-2017
162,162,15th December 2017,"['Increase in HTTPS phishing attacks\nOver the past few years website owners have been encouraged to adopt HTTPS website domains rather than HTTP. With HTTPS, data in transit is encrypted; this provides additional security for transiting data, such as login credentials, which may contain information of use to attackers.\nHTTPS domains are verified by SSL Certificate Authorities, who issue and authenticate certificates. The padlock symbol in the URL field links to the certificate provider’s website, and users are often advised to trust webpages with this symbol. However, while the padlock shows that encryption is used, it does not guarantee the legitimacy of the website. It is possible for attackers to compromise sites using HTTPS domains and use them to host malicious links. It is also easy for attackers to obtain legitimate certificates (often for free) and use them to set up their own malicious website.\nAlthough this rising attack trend has been previously reported, recent research by cyber security company PhishLabs highlights a common misconception amongst average internet users, that websites using SSL and HTTPS, as signified by the padlock, are safe and secure to use. This is not necessarily the case and attackers have increasingly exploited this misunderstanding. In the third quarter of 2017, PhishLabs found that nearly a quarter of all phishing attacks observed were hosted on HTTPS domains.\nTo avoid becoming a victim of HTTPS phishing attacks, users and organisations should not rely on a padlock or link to an SSL certificate alone to verify the legitimacy of a website. Other methods include paying close attention to the URL spelling and comparing it to a known and trusted version, and looking at the email source code to find the real name of a website or its IP address.\nThe NCSC provides guidance to help companies and individuals know what to worry about when using HTTPS to protect data.\nTriton malware targeting safety controllers\nThere have been reports in UK and international media outlets of a directed incident targeting the safety system of a critical infrastructure facility. FireEye Inc disclosed the incident on Thursday, saying it had targeted Triconex industrial safety technology from Schneider Electric SE.\nSchneider confirmed that the incident had occurred and that it had issued a security alert to users of Triconex. FireEye and Schneider declined to identify the victim, industry or location of the attack.\nThe NCSC confirmed that there was no evidence that the UK had been affected directly by this incident. Protecting and securing the UK’s critical systems against cyber attack is a key priority for the NCSC and its technical experts have been working with industry partners to ensure their critical systems are appropriately secure and the cyber risk is being properly managed.\nThreat actors exploit vulnerabilities with increasing speed\nResearch by information security company FireEye highlights the decreasing timeframe users have to apply new software patches once they are released. According to the research, an APT group was observed using an exploit for the Microsoft CVE-2017-11882 less than a week after Microsoft released a patch for it in November.\nThreat actors are increasingly able to develop new exploits in very short timeframes. In some cases, new patches will need to be applied within a week of release to avoid machines being vulnerable to freshly developed exploits. And the longer devices go unpatched, the more likely they are to fall victim to avoidable network penetration or data theft.\nThis trend of increasingly fast turnaround times for exploits is likely to continue. Some threat actors may soon be able to turn new exploits around in a matter of days, or even hours.\nThis threat can be mitigated through routine and well-implemented patching regimes. The NCSC’s End User Device Security collection has details about securing various platforms, and includes advice on patching.\nLatest digital currency breach\nAccording to media reports hackers stole the entire contents of the Bitcoin wallet of NiceHash, a Slovenian mining and Bitcoin exchange service. NiceHash are trying to determine exactly how many Bitcoins were stolen, but the figure is being widely reported as being over 4000, worth over £50 million at today’s Bitcoin exchange rate.\nAs the value of digital currencies, especially Bitcoin, has continued to increase, so has the investment interest in them, making digital currency exchanges a newly attractive target for cyber criminals. The last year has seen thefts from several cryptocurrency exchanges in South Korea and Israel. There has also been a reported increase in DDoS attacks against digital currency exchanges.\nThe attacks do temporarily affect the value of digital currencies, but have not deterred investors. However, potential investors should be aware that there is no physical acknowledgement of ownership when dealing with digital currencies and no underlying institutional backing. Nor is there a financial ombudsman or regulatory recourse to turn to. In a separate news report, Chris Ensor, the Deputy Director for Cyber Skills and Growth at the National Cyber Security Centre, told The Sunday Telegraph it was investigating potential security risks associated with Bitcoin on behalf of government departments (paywall).\nChris Ensor said: “We are interested in anything that could affect the country, so Bitcoin is a major thing now.” He said work on the cryptocurrency included assessing how it worked as the Treasury considered a crackdown, as well as the potential benefits of blockchain, its underlying technology.']",['Cyber attack'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-15th-december-2017

Investigations are ongoing but in a public blog post, the company’s CEO has said that, although passwords were hashed using SHA-256 at the time, users should still take precautions such as using a different password for every site and application.\nThe website does not hold any other personal data on its users beyond email addresses, but victims who use the same email and password combinations across multiple applications or websites may be at risk. This incident is indicative of an increasing frequency of online data breaches and it is important for users of online applications to diversify their passwords to prevent being targeted when their passwords are leaked on other platforms. It is also important for companies to use a recommended form of protection for passwords in databases.\nThe breach was discovered by a security researcher who highlighted the “exemplary” response by the company, in which action was taken just over 24 hours after it was alerted to the compromise.\nCompanies should be aware that Europe’s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation), which comes into force in May 2018, will be enforced by the UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office and will stipulate that data breaches must be responded to within 72 hours or a hefty fine will be issued. This could potentially amount to €20 million (approx £17.6m) or 4% of a firm's global turnover (whichever is greater).\nCyber criminals target the Regional Transit System in Sacramento, California\nCyber criminals have reportedly compromised the corporate IT system of the Sacramento Regional Transit District (SacRT), deleting internal operations data. SacRT is the sole operator of local public bus and tram services in the Sacramento area of California, but reports suggest services were unaffected by the breach.\nThe attack began when hackers defaced SacRT’s website, stating that they were “good hackers” seeking to help the organisation fix website vulnerabilities and requested SacRT contact them. When contacted, the attackers said they had access to corporate systems and demanded $7000 worth of Bitcoin be paid to prevent deletion of data. SacRT refused to pay the ransom resulting in approximately 30% of its data being deleted. This affected the organisation’s internal operations including the ability to dispatch employees and assign buses to routes.\nSacRT was able to make use of backups to restore the deleted data. The organisation also took down its website and shut down systems used to process credit card payments as a precaution. Passengers were still able to pay fares using cash and through SacRT’s mobile app that is hosted separately on a cloud-based system. It is reported that customer data was unaffected by the breach and that no data was stolen.\nThis incident demonstrates how quickly cyber attacks can escalate. It is important to maintain secure backups of business critical data to ensure organisations are able to recover from a range of incidents including a data deletion attack or ransomware.

The surge of bargain hunters seeking good deals on the high street and online inevitably attracts criminals looking to exploit this seasonal activity.\nLast year, victims reported losing nearly £16 million to Christmas shopping fraudsters, increasing from £10 million lost the year before. Responding to Action Fraud reports over last year’s festive period, the City of London Police requested the suspension of 658 websites, emails addresses and telephone numbers that fraudsters were using to commit their crimes.\nThis Christmas, the City of London Police who run Action Fraud, and supported by police forces across the country, have launched the ’It is the thought that counts’ campaign, encouraging people to slow down when Christmas shopping so that they are able to not only think about the gifts they are purchasing, but also who they are purchasing them from.

Known as IcedID, the malware uses web browser manipulation techniques to trick users into entering their login credentials and payment authorisation details into malicious webpages. The malware affects systems infected by the highly persistent Emotet banking trojan that hijacks computers to form botnet infrastructure for cyber crime.\nCustomers of two UK banks as well as those of some financial institutions in the US and Canada have so far reportedly been affected by IcedID. The number of customer victims and the scale of financial losses incurred is currently unknown.\nWe have seen a number of trojans targeting the banking sector, but IcedID stands out as it has only been in the wild since September, yet already demonstrates advanced capabilities. These capabilities are on a par with long-established banking trojans such as Dridex and Zeus which required many years to develop. The National Crime Agency estimates Dridex has resulted in approximately £20 million in losses to the UK economy. If IcedID capabilities are as good as reported then UK financial losses could be in line with these losses. IcedID capability will likely continue to be developed over coming weeks and months, increasing the risk of infection and potential scale of losses.\nConcerns over connected toys\nThe consumer organisation Which? recently published a safety report on its concerns over vulnerabilities in certain children’s toys with Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connectivity. It was able to show that several popular connected toys, which allow you and your child to interact with the toy via a smart device, had unsecured Bluetooth connections. These could potentially allow a stranger to make contact with your child through the toy.\nWhich? found that the Furby Connect, I-Que Intelligent Robot, Toy-fi Teddy and CloudPets cuddly toy all had unsecured Bluetooth connections because no password, PIN Code or any other authentication is necessary to gain access. Bluetooth usually has a 10-metre range limit, but can have a usable range up to around 100 metres, which could potentially put a child at risk from someone with malicious intentions nearby.\nLast year, Germany’s telecoms watchdog found similar unsecured accesses in the My Friend Cayla talking dolls and recommended that parents destroy them as they could be used to ‘illegally spy’ on their children. When purchasing connected toys for your child, consider reading up on known security issues, utilising any password protections and keeping Apps that control these toys updated.\nThe NCSC is urging manufacturers of these toys to improve security.\nSowbug targets South East Asia and South American governments\nCyber security company Symantec recently identified a new cyber espionage group called “Sowbug” that targets governments in South East Asia and South America. Sowbug uses a sophisticated piece of malware called “Felismus” that was discovered earlier this year by Forcepoint Security Labs.\nIt is currently unknown how Felismus infiltrates a target’s network but once deployed it can maintain a persistent presence, avoiding detection by disguising itself as an Adobe or Word file. The operators of the malware also appear to work outside the usual business hours of the victim, possibly to avoid arousing suspicion from legitimate users.\nSowbug uses Felismus to predominantly steal information relating to foreign policy, diplomatic relations and, specifically, Asia-Pacific relations. It has also been seen searching for files on remote shares in an attempt to infect other computers on the network.\nSowbug has probably been operating since at least early 2015, but its stealthy capabilities have enabled it to remain very low profile and evade detection.\nSowburg’s identity and primary motivation is currently unknown. There has been speculation this could be a state sponsored group due to the government targets, the sophistication of Felismus, and its success. Some of the malware code appeared to indicate that the operators’ first language may not be English.\nAlthough Sowbug appears to target a very specific set of victims, its modular capabilities are of particular concern. Organisations and members of the public should ensure that they keep their antivirus software up to date to avoid being infected with the Felismus malware.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

167,167,10th November 2017,"[""Dating apps may put users’ personal data at risk\nResearchers at Kaspersky Labs report that several popular online dating apps suffer from vulnerabilities in securing personal data. Users may be at risk of being deanonymized with their locations trackable and personally identifiable information (PII) in danger of being intercepted. Attackers could use the data for a variety of malicious purposes.\nPoor security during data transmission is a common problem. For example, some apps upload photos in plain HTTP without encryption. Other apps use HTTP for all transmissions back to the server, risking attackers intercepting data while in transit.\nSome apps also use a token-based authorisation process but do not store the tokens securely. Attackers could easily obtain authorisation tokens for Facebook, enabling full access to the associated account. Vulnerabilities also exist in several apps’ message history, particularly for Android users running outdated software.\nUsers wishing to use online dating apps should choose them with care and limit the amount of personal information they share.\nWas Bad Rabbit a smokescreen for a directed phishing attack on Ukraine?\nUkraine’s state cyber police say that malicious actors launched stealthy phishing attacks in conjunction with the Bad Rabbit ransomware attack in an apparent effort to obtain confidential data from victims. While the attack was ongoing, users of Russian-designed software that is widely used in Ukraine were targeted with a stream of phishing emails that attempted to obtain financial and other confidential information.\nThe Ukrainian state cyber police believe the same actors were behind both attacks and that Bad Rabbit provided camouflage for a highly-targeted, well-thought-out attack.\nIt is not uncommon for malicious cyber actors to exploit large-scale attacks as a smokescreen to conceal their own activities. However, the potential combination of the Bad Rabbit and Ukrainian phishing cases may indicate a more deliberate hybrid attack methodology. This is consistent with a general trend of malicious cyber campaigns that are increasingly complex, sophisticated and harder to detect as a result.\nNo UK victims have been reported in either of these attacks. Nevertheless, during large-scale attacks such as WannaCry or Petya/NotPetya, there will be an increased threat to UK organisations and individuals from opportunistic cyber attacks.\nScammers compromising email accounts to carry out fraud\nBusiness Email Compromise (BEC) scams are becoming an increasingly common and attractive proposition for cyber criminals due to the high potential rewards. The security technologist, Bruce Schneier, has written recently on examples in the US real estate sector and fine art organisations in the UK and US, where compromised email accounts have enabled attackers to defraud individuals of significant sums of money. The FBI has assessed the cost to victims as at least $5 billion over a three-year period.\nA would-be attacker can gain significant advantages and improved chances of success if they are able to read a company’s email. A recent blog by the NCSC's Technical Director, Ian Levy, highlights the considerable challenge of identifying malicious emails, but also notes that spoofed domains, inconsistent display names and inauthentic language can act as clues that potential victims may be able to spot.\nMany of these pitfalls can be avoided by attackers who acquire access to a company’s email account. A capable attacker may spend weeks or months studying the language and formatting of legitimate emails and send requests from legitimate domains, making it less likely that recipients will be suspicious. The NCSC website has previously provided guidance on Whaling and avoiding Phishing attacks.\nPoor account management practices put privileged accounts at risk\nMany businesses are reportedly using a mix of internally developed tools, scripts, spreadsheets and paper-based tracking to manage their administrative and other privileged access accounts. As cyber security professionals have warned, however, this presents potential risks.\nPrivileged account credentials allow administrators to log in and manage key network devices such as servers, firewalls, database servers and management applications. A recently released survey of more than 900 IT professionals in seven countries, including the UK, found that 67 percent of organisations were using two or more tools to manage privileged accounts. This indicates widespread inconsistencies between organisations’ approaches to privileged account management.\nPrivileged accounts are a primary target for a range of cyber adversaries, including cyber criminals and state actors. Once a system is compromised, adversaries will seek out users with elevated privileges to facilitate further movement across the corporate network. One way they do this is by locating files containing plain text user credentials, which are used to silently move across the network in pursuit of further exploitation or malware deployment. Secondary attacks are likely to result in financial and reputational impacts for the victim organisation.\nIt is important that organisations implement consistent, best practices for privileged access management without creating roadblocks that hinder work getting done. For NCSC mitigation advice on managing user privileges see '10 Steps: Managing User Privileges'.\nSocial media users targeted by supermarket voucher scam\nSecurity researchers, Action Fraud and numerous UK supermarkets are warning customers of fake messages claiming that they will get vouchers worth up to £250 if they complete a survey. The messages are sent on WhatsApp, Twitter and Facebook, as well as via text and email. They encourage users to click on a link that looks like a supermarket’s legitimate website address.\nThe addresses are in fact fakes, with letters replaced by very similar-looking accented characters or homographs – for instance, substituting the letter ‘d’ with ‘ḍ’ or ’đ’ to produce an address such as ‘asḍa.com’ instead of the legitimate asda.com. Since most people will be reading these messages on small smartphone screens, it will often be difficult to spot these homographs.\nIf the victim clicks on the link, a survey will appear asking for their personal financial information. Once completed, the victim is told they will receive a £250 voucher if they send the survey to another 20 contacts. This makes the scam appear more plausible, as people are more likely to respond to a message from a trusted contact rather than a random number.\nSupermarkets are advising customers to delete these messages and not to pass them on. If in doubt, look on the supermarket’s legitimate website and search for any vouchers, or manually type in the supposed address of the offer and see if that page exists.\nPhishing emails (such as the ones in last week's Threat Report about false speeding fines) and fake offers such as these can be very convincing, and therefore difficult to spot. However tempting it may be to click on the links, take time to think about it. If an offer looks too good to be true, then it probably is!\nFurther information about phishing can be read here, and the 28th April 2017 Threat Report discusses homographic phishing attacks.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

168,168,3rd November 2017,"['Fake speeding notices deliver malware\nPolice forces around the UK are warning motorists not to be taken in by a phishing email falsely informing them that they need to pay a speeding fine. The realistic-looking email, entitled ‘Notice of Prosecution’, claims to have ‘photographic’ evidence, but clicking on the associated link will upload banking malware to the victim’s device.\nThe email appears official, with the logos of either the local police force or ‘gov.uk’, but there are several features that indicate that it is fake. Spelling and grammatical errors are fairly obvious, but the speed at which the vehicle was allegedly caught is unrealistic, e.g. travelling at 89mph in an area with a 25mph speed limit. Phishing emails rely on several factors to be successful, including evading spam filters, the appearance of credibility, and being able to make the recipient take action immediately.\nThe police have advised that any ‘Notice of Prosecution’ would be posted to the vehicle owner’s address and never sent in an email. They also advised people to delete the email without clicking on any links.\nThere have been motoring and phishing-themed phishing email campaigns conducted in the past, with Action Fraud highlighting a previous one in December 2016.\nRead the NCSC guidance for avoiding phishing attacks.\nCode-signing certificates worth more than guns on the Dark Web\nAn investigation by a company specialising in identity protection solutions, into the sale of code-signing certificates on the Dark Web suggests they are selling for up to $1,200, making them more expensive than fake driver’s licences, stolen credit cards, commissioning a targeted cyber attack, or even buying a handgun. This relatively high price presumably reflects customer demand.\nThis is not the first time that security researchers have highlighted the issue of stolen or fraudulently obtained code-signing certificates. Since at least 2011, they have noted a trend for both cyber criminals and APT cyber actors to sign their malware using stolen or fraudulently obtained certificates to bypass security measures. Signed code tends to be treated as trusted and some operating systems will flag up, or refuse to run, code that is not signed.\nOver the years, attackers have managed to sign their malicious executables with certificates obtained by a variety of methods – reportedly stealing them from technology companies (including some well-known names), penetrating the networks of companies and using their signing facilities, or applying for certificates in the names of fake companies or real companies who have no need for them. As far back as 2010, the destructive worm Stuxnet included components that were signed with stolen certificates. More recently, the cyber actors who corrupted an update of clean-up tool CCleaner managed to get the update signed.\nAmongst other things, this highlights the fact that, when attackers do manage to penetrate a network, they will often seek out things that facilitate further intrusions – like passwords (not only password caches, but sometimes also emails containing passwords or access codes), cookies, digital certificates and keys. System administrators should make sure they know where these are located.\nThe NCSC has published guidance to help organisations protect their End User Devices which, when deployed correctly, can help mitigate the risks of malware attacks.\nThe Dark Overlord – Systematic cyber-enabled extortion\nA cyber crime group called ‘The Dark Overlord’ has claimed responsibility for conducting cyber-enabled extortion campaigns in recent weeks. Victims include a London-based plastic surgery clinic and a Hollywood production studio, both of which are believed to have a number of high-profile clients. The group has a history of hacking organisations to obtain sensitive information before demanding money in exchange for not leaking it into the public domain. They leak snippets of data to the media to encourage them to report on their activity. This is aimed at “proving” that a breach has taken place, and increases the pressure on the victim to pay the ransom. ‘The Dark Overlord’ has been responsible for indiscriminately targeting health institutions, schools and media production companies over the last year.\nAny organisation that deals with sensitive personal information (e.g. medical institutions, law firms) is at a higher risk of being targeted, and owes a particular duty of care to its clients because of the risk of severe emotional distress if client data is made public. Whilst evidence of the stolen data is often provided, the volume and sensitivity of the data may be exaggerated to maximise impact. This may inspire other cyber extortionists to adopt a similar methodology, especially as new opportunities present themselves due to an increasing amount of sensitive data being stored online. Any data breach and the associated media exposure may cause significant reputational damage and loss of business.\nFurthermore, breaches can impact systems that have not been breached if a user has a shared password between the services. The NCSC has produced guidance on passwords and how password managers can help users.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

169,169,27th October 2017,"['Bad Rabbit ransomware\nThis week, ‘Bad Rabbit’ ransomware infections have been reported in countries including Russia, Ukraine, Bulgaria, Turkey, Germany and Japan. The NCSC has not received any reports that the UK has been affected by this latest malware attack. The majority of infections have been in Russia, where media organisations were worst affected. Russia’s Interfax News Agency suffered outages to several of its services, including its news portal. Ukrainian victims included the Ministry of Infrastructure, Odessa airport and Kiev metro.\nBad Rabbit asks victims to pay 0.05 Bitcoin (currently worth approximately £210) to restore their files. A smal number of transactions are reported to have been made, although these are unconfirmed, and it is currently unknown whether paying the ransom leads to decryption of files. The infection vector is believed to be via certain compromised media websites in the affected regions, which asks the user to execute a fake Adobe Flash Player update. Researchers including FireEye and Crowdstrike have identified several links between Bad Rabbit and the NotPetya ransomware, including the use of similar Javascript code to redirect victims. While claims have been made that Bad Rabbit made use of the EternalBlue exploit leveraged by WannaCry and NotPetya, these have been widely refuted; subsequent claims have been made that the EternalRomance exploit was leveraged.\nIt is currently unclear who is responsible for this ransomware. NCSC technical analysis is ongoing to provide more clarity on technical indicators. There are no reported UK victims to date. Nevertheless, it should be noted that UK organisations would be vulnerable were they to visit any of the infected websites. In the case of NotPetya for instance, a number of UK organisations were infected. The NCSC has provided some mitigation advice in its public statement, highlighting the importance of patching, using proper antivirus services and having effective backup procedures. In addition to this, Bad Rabbit makes use of a set of hard-coded username/password combinations in order to attempt to spread to SMB shares on the local network. Organisations should ensure that these username/password combinations do not exist anywhere on their network, and in general that they follow good password practices (as per NCSC password guidance).\nIs Reaper the new Mirai?\nIn September, cyber security firms reported the discovery of a new botnet that targets, and could already have infected millions of, vulnerable internet connected devices.\nThe botnet (named variously as ‘IoTroop’; ‘IoT_reaper’ or ‘reaper’) has been targeting a number of known vulnerabilities found in popular device brands including internet connected cameras and Wi-Fi routers.\nReaper is being compared to the Mirai botnet which caused serious disruption to the Dyn domain name server provider and thousands of customer websites in October 2016. Some of Reaper’s code is reportedly similar to Mirai, however, researchers believe Reaper has many more capabilities than Mirai and the potential to cause a lot more damage. The fast rate that Reaper has been infecting devices is also concerning and the attacker appears to be updating the malware regularly.\nThe purpose of the Reaper botnet is currently unclear as it does not yet appear to have been used for malicious purposes. It is possible that, like the Hajime botnet identified earlier this year, there will be speculation that it has been developed to stop vulnerable devices being harnessed for malicious activity, but it would be best to assume the worst until proven otherwise.\nEnsuring your devices are fully patched and limiting access to these devices will help protect from compromise. For further advice see our 10 steps to cyber security (Secure Configuration and Network Security).\nWashington Cyber Conference reportedly targeted by hackers\nThe International Conference on Cyber Conflict (CyCon) will be held 7-8 November in Washington and will host a high-level gathering of NATO and US military cyber experts.\nA recent Cisco report has highlighted that this conference has been targeted by cyber actors known as ‘APT28’ and ‘Fancy Bear’. Cisco report that this actor has modified an existing Microsoft Word flyer publicising the conference, added reconnaissance malware to it and has conducted an email campaign to infect potential victims. The modified document contains an embedded Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) macro which is executed when the document is opened and automatically installs the malware. Running any macro within any externally produced Microsoft Word document will usually generate a warning which must be explicitly approved by the user. However, the user is more likely to override the warning and execute the macro if the malware-bearing email appears to be from a legitimate contact.\nWord and PDF documents are one of the most common ways to spread malware, so, as a security measure, Microsoft deliberately turned off auto-execution of macros by default many years ago. Many current malware infections rely on persuading the user to turn macros back on. We assess with high confidence that cyber actors will likely continue to use creative and current specialised topics to compromise targets. It is likely that this campaign has been targeting people linked to government/military cyber security.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

The exploit is called “KRACK”, which is short for Key Reinstallation Attack. Reports suggest that at most risk are Linux operating systems, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and 41% of Android devices. However, many of these, especially IoT devices, may never get patched.\nFor further detail on this flaw, please see our KRACK guidance and the latest blog.\nSwedish transport networks hit by DDoS attacks\nMedia reported last week that trains were delayed in Sweden after the transport sector was successfully targeted by a series of DDoS attacks. On 11 October, two communication service providers serving the Swedish Transport Administration (Trafikverket) were hit by a DDoS attack, reportedly causing the Trafikverket’s train management system to go down for several hours. Consequently, manual procedures had to be used to handle rail traffic, resulting in delays for the rest of the day. The company also had to resort to using Facebook to keep customers updated as its email system and website were also unavailable. The following day, DDoS attacks targeted the Swedish Transport Agency (Transportyrelsen) and a public transport operator serving Western Sweden (Västtrafik). The impact of these attacks was less severe, briefly affecting web services including ticket booking.\nSome media reports speculate that a state-linked actor may have been responsible, however investigations into the incidents continue. Overall, the case highlights how transport firms can be impacted by attacks on third party service providers (in this case, Trafikverket’s communication service providers).\nCyber-enabled intimidation of NATO personnel in Baltics\nAccording to open source reporting, advanced surveillance techniques (possibly including drone monitoring and/or IMSI grabbing) are being used to pull data from personal smartphones of NATO personnel despite warnings not to use them following previous incidents. There are accounts of personnel then being approached in public by individuals who convey details pulled from smartphones – in one example details about the personnel’s family.\nThis is not the first time NATO personnel operating in Europe have reported call interference or unusual behaviour by their mobile phones. Mobile devices operating over the public telephone system are susceptible to exploitation including interception of communications or tracking of the user. The capability to mount operations against personal electronic devices, including the use of rogue cell towers is within technical and financial reach of well-resourced threat actors. However, the more recent reporting is different as exploitation of devices has been followed up by personal approaches.\nIt is almost certain that personal mobile devices will increasingly become targets for a wide range of threat actors due to the amounts of personal information they hold, which is useful for espionage, targeting and criminal purposes. Personal mobiles are susceptible to a range of compromise vectors and have widely varying levels of cyber hygiene. This threat could expand beyond NATO personnel to businesses operating in the region or individuals traversing these areas on business or personal trips.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

It is not yet known how much the attackers attempted to steal, but open source reports this figure could be as high as 60 million USD. FEIB states that, owing to errors by the criminals in their SWIFT[1] messaging configuration and efforts to recover the stolen money, estimated losses are less than 500,000 USD.\nFEIB’s network was reportedly affected by an unknown strain of malware that passed undetected by the bank’s antivirus software. This initially slowed down the system, potentially as a distraction for the security team. Early indicators suggest the initial malware delivery mechanism was a spear-phishing email, although this is yet to be confirmed.\nIt is currently too early to draw conclusions as to who was responsible. However, two individuals have been arrested in Colombo, Sri Lanka, whilst withdrawing money from beneficiary accounts.\nAt this stage, there is no information to suggest the SWIFT network has been compromised. On the other hand, it does demonstrate that competent actors will attempt to exploit local security vulnerabilities to circumnavigate the central network system. It is possible other actors will be inspired to attempt similar high-yield attacks.\n1 The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications (SWIFT) is a secure messaging system that enables financial institutions worldwide to send and receive information about financial transactions.\nMergers and Acquisitions – Don’t forget cyber security due diligence!\nRigzone is one of the oil and gas industry’s main recruitment and networking websites. It was founded in the US in 2000 by David W Kent, who sold the site ten years later for $51million.\nMr Kent went on to found Oilpro which served a very similar purpose and clientele to Rigzone. Kent used backdoors he had inserted before he sold Rigzone to gain access to company data at a later date. Between 2013 and 2016, Kent scraped 700,000 customer accounts which were used to increase membership on the Oilpro website. Having built Oilpro with members stolen from Rigzone, Kent then approached the owners of Rigzone to purchase Oilpro, asking them, in effect, to purchase their own data.\nFollowing suspicions, the owners of Rigzone deployed a honeypot on their system which allowed them to identify suspicious activity and build evidence against Mr Kent. Mr Kent was subsequently arrested, convicted and sentenced to over a year in prison for intentionally accessing a computer without authorisation. The Oilpro website was taken offline in August 2017. The case is a reminder to companies involved with mergers or acquisitions to undertake cyber security due diligence to ensure they understand the key security considerations required to protect their investment.\nEquifax Update\nEquifax have now confirmed that the personal data of up to 15.2 million UK customers was stolen during the data breach it experienced in May 2017.\nThe majority of these compromised records may contain the name and date of birth of certain UK consumers, but Equifax have stated that they will contact by post the 693,665 customers who had sensitive data exposed.\nMore information and advice for UK Equifax customers affected by the data breach can be found here.\nCiSP\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

172,172,6th October 2017,"['Whole Foods Market credit card data breach\nWhole Foods Market, a US-headquartered supermarket with a small UK presence, has reported it is investigating a credit card breach. The store warned of unauthorised access to the credit card data of customers using restaurants and ‘tap rooms’ in its stores. The cards used by customers at store checkouts are not thought to have been affected. Investigations are still underway; however, it is likely the card data was acquired through compromised Point of Sale (PoS) devices. PoS devices are small electronic computers used to swipe credit cards at checkouts.\nAt this stage, the possibility of UK victims cannot be ruled out. However, all affected stores reported to date have been in the US and the US has typically been disproportionately affected by PoS card breaches due to the way US PoS terminals are used. This instance acts a timely reminder to all PoS operators of the potential for exploitation of software vulnerabilities within PoS terminals to acquire and exfiltrate large amounts of customer card data.\nData acquired from breaches such as this provides an additional attack vector for criminals. The stolen data can be used for fraud and spear-phishing attempts. Whole Foods’ separation of its PoS networks between its restaurants and stores reportedly limited the extent of the breach. Lessons can be learned from this on the segmentation of business networks where possible.\nWhole Foods Market encourages its customers to closely monitor their card statements and report any unauthorised charges to the issuing bank. Customers are reminded to look out for small transactions, as this may indicate criminals testing that the card works before attempting larger transactions.\nNational Lottery Denial of Service\nCyber security research company We Live Security earlier this week reported that the UK National Lottery’s official website and associated app had suffered a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

173,173,29th September 2017,"[""Compromise of Deloitte\nThe Guardian this week reported that the global accountancy firm Deloitte had been hit by a cyber attack that has revealed client email addresses. The hackers may have also accessed usernames, passwords and personal details.\nDeloitte provides auditing, tax consultancy and cyber security advice to some of the world’s biggest banks, multi-national companies, media enterprises, pharmaceutical firms and US government agencies. According to the Guardian, Deloitte clients across these sectors had material in the company email system that was breached. The breach was believed to be US-focussed, affecting well-known companies as well as US Government departments. The compromise was discovered in March this year, but it was reported that the attackers may have had access to Deloitte systems since October or November 2016.\nAccording to the newspaper, the hacker compromised the firm’s Microsoft Azure Cloud global email server through an administrator’s account that, in theory, provided them with privileged, unrestricted access. The account required only a single password and did not have “two-step“ verification. Emails to and from Deloitte’s 244,000 staff were stored in the Azure cloud service which is Microsoft’s equivalent to Amazon Web Service and Google’s Cloud Platform.\nDeloitte has stated on its website that only very few clients were impacted and no disruption has occurred to client businesses, to Deloitte’s ability to serve clients, or to consumers. The NCSC statement confirmed that we had engaged with the organisation to better understand the threat and based on current information we understand there to have been minimal UK impact.\nUsing a single factor authentication system like a username and an easy-to-guess password combination has allowed criminals to gain access to a user's account. Simple passwords based on dictionaries or the same passwords used on other systems that may have been leaked can give cyber attackers easy access to IT systems. Gaining access to the administrator account is the ‘jackpot’ for an attacker and will provide an attacker with unrestricted access to all user accounts.\nTwo Factor Authentication (or 2FA) is an extra layer of security that requires not only a password and username but also something that only that user has on them, i.e. a piece of information only they should know or have immediately to hand - such as a physical token, keyfob device, fingerprint, facial recognition or SMS confirmation via mobile phone.\nA compromise would be highly unlikely if a complex password or 2FA had been implemented. See the NCSC’s Password Guidance.\nBanks’ concerns about cloud cyber security\nInvestment bank Goldman Sachs has in recent days echoed concerns about the number of banks using the same small number of Cloud storage providers – pointing out that those users also include the UK financial regulatory bodies.\nThe bank’s Head of Technology for Europe, Middle East and Africa argues that the online platforms should be regulated from a resilience perspective, and describes a ‘concentration risk’. The concerns echo those voiced in January by the Bank of England Governor and the chair of the Financial Stability Board, who refer to the risk of a single point of failure if ‘banks come to rely on common hosts of online banking or providers of Cloud computing services’.\nThe use of an online network, or ‘Cloud’, increases the scale and flexibility of computing capacity, and aligns with the growing desire within the financial services industry for innovative technological business models and processes.\nThe Financial Stability Board (FSB) alerted the industry in June to the greater reliance on external providers of technology, and hence the potential risk of disruption, specifically citing the Cloud. The FSB highlighted the risks of financial institutions relying on the same third-party Cloud computing and data services providers, and cited other jurisdictions where, for example, guidelines had been issued for Cloud outsourcing, internet banking and technology risk management. Greater co-ordination within finance, and with non-finance partner organisations such as those with a remit for cyber security, was mooted.\nSome of the growing concerns voiced within financial services about the Cloud are addressed by the NCSC’s Cloud Security Principles and advice.\nCryptocurrency mining by cyber criminals\nRecent IBM reporting observes a sixfold increase in the use of specifically CPU-based cryptocurrency-mining malware since the beginning of 2017, a much faster rise than observed for cryptocurrency-mining malware more generally.\nWhile there are many cryptocurrencies, with different characteristics, all rely on ‘miners’, who carry out large number of calculations to verify transactions. In exchange for contributing computing power, miners are rewarded with cryptocurrency.\nMining many currencies using a CPU has generally become economically unviable for legitimate users, as running costs outweigh their gains, so they now use graphics cards, or specially designed application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). Running costs are no obstacle to cyber criminals, however, who can use botnets of compromised machines as miners without needing to worry about the electricity bills. Some newer currencies are also more feasible to mine using a CPU only.\nIn a related trend, an increasing number of website scripts are being observed which mine cryptocurrency inside a web browser. Such scripts can be used in clearly illegal ways when hidden within adverts (a form of malvertising), but some sites have also shown an interest in such scripts as a form of revenue production to replace or supplement online advertising. Torrenting site The Pirate Bay received significant press coverage when it was revealed to have adopted such scripts without the knowledge or consent of its users. There have also been reports of cyber criminals compromising popular websites and hiding mining scripts in their source code, allowing them to profit from their victim’s visitors.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

This tactic of targeting through supply chains, exploiting the trust between consumers and suppliers, provides wide scope for infection, as illustrated by the case of NotPetya malware which spread via Ukrainian accounting software.\nAvast, the parent company of CCleaner developers Piriform, initially reported that 2.27 million computers were affected from 15 August 2017 to 15 September 2017, although this was later reduced to 700,000 machines. On 15 September, the command and control server was taken down by US law enforcement. Based on analysis of the server, Avast suggests that several hundred machines may have received a second stage payload.\nThe incident has been described as a highly targeted attack, with intellectual property being the probable target. A list of twenty specific targets included large technology and telecommunications companies based in the UK, Taiwan, Japan, Germany, and the United States. Avast reports it has notified companies affected by the second stage malware. It advises home users of the affected version of CCleaner to upgrade to the latest version, and to use a good antivirus product. Business customers have been advised to speak with their IT departments.\nBlueBorne Vulnerability\nSecurity researchers at Armis disclosed a collection of eight Bluetooth vulnerabilities this week, collectively known as BlueBorne. Three of the eight vulnerabilities identified have been deemed ‘critical’. The vulnerabilities pose a threat to Bluetooth implementations in Android, iOS, Microsoft and Linux, and reportedly impact almost all Bluetooth device types including smartphones, laptops, IoT devices, and smart cars. Over 5.3 billion devices worldwide are thought to be affected by Blueborne.\nIf exploited, the BlueBorne vulnerabilities could enable an attacker to take over devices, spread malware, or establish a ‘man-in-the-middle’ to gain access to critical data and networks without a user’s knowledge or permission. These attacks do not require targeted devices to be paired to the attacker’s device – Bluetooth implementations have high privileges on all operating systems, so exploiting them provides virtually full control over a device. By probing the device, an attacker can determine which operating system their victim is using, and adjust the exploit accordingly. The attacker then exploits a vulnerability in the implementation of the Bluetooth protocol in the relevant platform, and gains the required access to act in furtherance of a malicious objective.\nAs part of a coordinated disclosure, Google and Microsoft have already made patches available to their customers. However, according to researchers, a large proportion of devices will not receive BlueBorne patches due to devices having reached ‘end of life’ and no longer being supported. It is reported that only 45% of Android phones are patchable, leaving approximately one billion Android devices running older operating systems vulnerable.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

Criminals are also interested in stealing student data, and other personal data held by researchers, which they can abuse for identity fraud. There are some reports of cyber criminals specifically targeting universities.\nA number of factors can make university networks particularly challenging to secure. Individual departments often design their systems independently to best suit local research requirements, and ‘bring your own device’ (BYOD) is ubiquitous, restricting the ability of central IT security teams to manage vulnerabilities, especially in the growing number of UK universities with overseas campuses. In addition, universities’ ethos of openness, and the role of networks in providing internet access for personal use as well as work, can make it harder to establish and maintain robust security culture and awareness.\nTwitter bots\nSecurity researcher Brian Krebs has drawn attention to a phenomenon whereby commentators seeking to expose social media manipulation and fake news are being targeted – and in an unusual way. Instead of more standard denial-of-service attacks against their websites, something which Krebs has previously experienced, he and other reporters covering this type of story are now finding that they have suddenly attracted suspiciously large numbers of new followers and retweets. This increase in activity results in a danger that their Twitter accounts could be suspended because of mechanisms introduced by the social media channel to clamp down on abuse.\nLocky ransomware\nThere has been widespread media and finance sector reporting of Locky ransomware incidents following large spam runs in August. New variants have been seen in the wild, with campaigns directed at the UK. Locky ransomware uses various forms of social engineering to entice the unsuspecting victim to enable macros on their computer which in turn downloads and executes the ransomware. The victim is then sent payment instructions. There is no free decryption tool and, currently, the ransom is 0.5 Bitcoin (approx. 1,800GBP).\nThe NCSC has published guidance to help protect organisations against cyber attacks and reminds users to always be mindful of good cyber hygiene. Remember, don’t open attachments if you are unsure who has sent it, and be suspicious of pop-up messages.\nWe would like to encourage sharing of information so please log in to the Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) to upload your intelligence regarding Locky, and also to see the latest Indicators of Compromise shared amongst the community.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

The remainder came from 116 countries and regions, with Korea the lowest at just 3.1% of attacks.\nAirline boarding passes and baggage bar code stickers\nSince at least 2011 security experts have warned that an airline boarding pass can provide would-be attackers access with a host of sensitive passenger information.\nA recent Krebs on Security blog reports on a person posting a photo of their boarding pass on Facebook. Online software can be used to scan the bar code, even when redacted from the photo. The passenger name and booking reference will generally provide enough information to gain access to the booking on most airline websites; with this access, a malicious actor could obtain additional data, including future travel plans, and alter or cancel upcoming flights.\nThe article reports that many people post pictures of their boarding pass on social networking sites often before and/or during their trip. A search on Instagram for ‘boarding pass’ returned 91,000 images.\nPosting pictures of boarding passes, luggage revealing airline bar code stickers or even concert tickets will provide attackers with a host of personally identifiable information that could result in the user having no return flight, missing a concert or even full identity theft.\nUS-CERT warns of potential Hurricane Harvey phishing scams\nThe US Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) has issued public warnings regarding potential Hurricane Harvey-related scams. Cyber criminals have been seen trying to deceive users through email phishing and fraudulent social media accounts that reference both the hurricane and associated charities and aid organisations. These methods have been used to ask users to send money or to redirect them to malicious websites that either download malware or steal personal data.\nCyber criminals have previously exploited natural disasters or global events such as Hurricane Sandy, the Ebola outbreak and the Syrian conflict to steal donations intended to help those affected. US-CERT is advising caution in handling emails with subject lines, attachments or hyperlinks related to Harvey, even if they appear to originate from a trusted source. Potential donors are further advised to check the credentials of charities and webpages that appear after such events before responding.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

178,178,25th August 2017,"['Data breach affects NHS administrative information\nAn individual affiliating themselves with the hacktivist collective Anonymous claims to have stolen UK NHS patient data. The attacker claims to have exploited unpatched vulnerabilities in software provided by SwiftQueue, a vendor responsible for managing a number of hospital appointment booking systems.\nSwiftQueue have confirmed an unauthorised party accessed 32,501 lines of administrative data. This is likely to include personally identifiable information (PII) on individuals including names, telephone numbers and email addresses. It is possible that the breach exposed a small amount of more sensitive personal data, although no medical information was held on the system.\nWhen third parties are responsible for aggregating and storing large data sets they become an attractive target for criminal activity. This is primarily due to the large amounts of data that can be stolen in a single attack. Third parties have previously been targeted in this way across UK industry. The need to conduct due diligence on the cyber security practices of third parties is essential to mitigate against these sorts of attacks.\nThis incident coincides with findings from the fraud prevention service Cifas on a record 89,000 cases of identity fraud reported in the first six months of this year. Identity fraud typically involves criminals pretending to be someone they are not to steal money, buy items or take out loans. Data breaches such as this make life easier for fraudsters who first seek PII on individuals to conduct fraudulent activity.\nRemoving IT accesses from former employees\nA survey released in July 2017 by researchers at OneLogin of 500 US IT decision makers revealed concerning findings on processes for removing IT accesses from former employees.\nNearly half of respondents were reportedly aware of former employees who retained access to corporate accounts after leaving, and in a quarter of cases, employees remained active more than a week after departure. Most concerningly, in a quarter of cases, respondents did not know how long accounts had remained inactive.\nWe have written previously about publicly reported examples from the US of disgruntled ex-employees exploiting privileges to cause disruption. In 2014, a former sys admin caused a US paper manufacturing company $1.1 million worth of damage by using network accesses to influence Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Separately, a former engineer used corporate software to disable meter reading equipment at several US water utility companies. Had such accesses been removed, such damage would have likely been prevented.\nFormer employees’ retention of previously legitimate accesses may also offer an opportunity for threat actors, such as cyber criminals or states, seeking to recruit insiders. A study released earlier this year noted increased efforts by cyber criminals to use the dark web to recruit insiders.\nThe survey noted the growing number of applications being used within organisations, presenting an increased overhead compared with the smaller number of tools used previously. However, failure to implement proper deprovisioning processes (or single-sign on) is likely to be a false economy. The cost of a consequent data breach may be significant, and could include remediation costs, fines or commercial impact. Furthermore, where accesses pertain to operational technology systems such as ICS, there may be an impact on production, incurring further cost, as well as potential safety issues.\nThe study and examples noted above are from the US, but UK companies are likely to face the same challenges. The NCSC provides guidance on managing user privileges.\nDownturn in exploit kit market\nIn mid-August, adverts for a new exploit kit were seen on Russian-language hacking forums. The exploit kit is known as ‘Disdain’ and was being made available for rent for certain time periods for a fee, e.g. $1,400 for a month. It appears to be a rehash of open source code from the Sundown/BEPS exploit kit, which was leaked in March 2017. The exploits mentioned in Disdain’s advert are mainly older browser and Adobe Flash exploits, all of which have patches available. It is not certain that Disdain will be able to establish itself as an effective option for cyber criminals.\nHowever, it is still notable that Disdain has appeared at all, given that there has been a significant downturn in the exploit kit market, with very few new exploit kits appearing since the takedown of Angler in 2016. Other exploit kits such as Sundown and Neutrino have dropped off or ceased activity.\nA number of factors are likely to have contributed to the decline of exploit kits. For example, the availability of suitable browser exploits has decreased. Adobe Flash, a key target for exploitation, will reach its end-of-life by 2020 and browsers such as Chrome, Firefox and Edge have already moved to minimise support for the plugin. This makes it harder for exploit kits to remain an effective method of compromising victim machines, whilst also impacting on the profitability of running an exploit kit.\nHowever, exploit kits remain a potent tool for cyber criminals and still represent a threat, especially if security updates are not regularly applied. Even rudimentary exploit kits like Disdain can still have a real impact.\nCryptocurrencies defrauded at Initial Coin Offerings\nIn recent months, there have been two highly publicised cases of cybercriminals defrauding cryptocurrency Initial Coin Offerings, apparently using simple website and email exploits.\nICOs allow investors to buy a newly released cryptocurrency. In many ways ICOs are similar to Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) on stock markets, but unlike IPOs they are unregulated, making them potentially more risky for investors.\nIn these instances, attackers gained access to the website and email accounts of organisations coordinating the ICOs, and changed the payment addresses to ones they control. Would-be investors inadvertently sent money to criminals rather than the ICO.\nAs investment in cryptocurrency becomes increasingly mainstream, ICOs will become more attractive targets for attackers. Such cases also emphasise that overall security is only as good as its weakest link: attackers won’t attempt complex attacks on cryptographic blockchains if they can achieve similar results by simple website or email exploits.\nUkraine’s Central Bank warns of new malware threat\nOn 18 August, Ukraine’s central bank informed state-owned and private lenders of a new malware spread by opening email attachments of word documents. The bank shared details of the malware’s features as well as indicators of compromise, urging banks to put in place precautionary measures to prevent possible infection. The malware had not been detected by any anti-virus systems, meaning banks and other institutions could be vulnerable to attack if they were not fully patched.\nThis new threat comes at a time when Ukrainian institutions are still recovering from the effects of the NotPetya attack on 27 June which affected many Ukrainian government agencies and businesses before spreading beyond Ukraine through corporate networks of multinationals. As with NotPetya, this malware has the potential indirectly to affect any UK institutions with a presence in Ukraine or if the malware spreads through connected networks to the UK and other countries. Although Kiev’s central bank has been working hard with the government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) and police to improve the defences of the Ukrainian banking sector, the appearance of this new malware is a reminder of the constant need to review and upgrade cyber defences against an ever-evolving threat.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

179,179,18th August 2017,"['Hotels targeted across Europe and the Middle-East<\nRecent media reporting has highlighted a campaign targeting the hospitality sector.\nThe campaign, which reportedly started in July 2017 and may be linked to a similar campaign carried out during the autumn of 2016, is allegedly being carried out by Fancy Bear, also known as APT28. The group has also been implicated in the hack-and-leak campaign against the Democratic National Committee (DNC) during the 2016 US Presidential Elections.\nUsing EternalBlue, an exploit now infamous for its use in the WannaCry malware campaign, Fancy Bear have allegedly been seeking access to hotel Wi-Fi networks to install malware on guest devices connecting to targeted networks. According to researchers, the attackers may have been able to gain access to victim’s data, including emails, and to harvest online credentials.\nThe hacking campaign, which has been noted predominantly in mid-upmarket hotels in European capitals and the Middle East, could be targeting foreign government and business travellers. Travellers should be aware of their digital security when travelling overseas. Where possible, travellers are advised not to connect to insecure or untrusted Wi-Fi networks.\nUkrainian post office DDoS and changes in attack methodology\nIn early August, the website of the national postal service of Ukraine, Ukrposhta, suffered multiple Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks occurring over two days. These attacks temporarily disabled the online systems used for tracking customer parcels and shipments. In June, the Ukrainian postal service was also significantly affected by the Petya/NotPetya worldwide ransomware attack which also affected Ukrainian banking, state-owned power companies, television and public transport services.\nAccording to security company Imperva, repeated DDoS attacks, targeting the same network, have become more common possibly due to their ability to disrupt some security measures and cause fatigue to those in charge of attack mitigation forcing them to stay alert even in quiet times between attacks.\nThere have been some significant changes to the DDoS attack methodology over the last year with Imperva reporting that three quarters of those experiencing DDoS attacks in Q1 2017 were targeted multiple times. Since Q4 2016, the number of DDoS attacks has decreased by about one quarter but conversely the size of individual attacks increased by one quarter. According to internet security company, Verisign, in Q1 2017 58% of DDoS attacks targeted the IT services/cloud/SaaS industry, 28% targeted financial services and 6% targeted media and entertainment. The average cost of a DDoS attack, according to data service provider Neustar now exceeds $2.5 million in lost revenue.\nUS Internal Revenue Service warns of fake tax software update scam\nJust in time for the seasonal upgrading of tax software in the U.S., the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has warned of a scam that tricks tax professionals into downloading fake software updates, to harvest log in credentials.\nThe scammer sends phishing emails with the subject ""Software Support Update"" and emphasise the requirement for an important software update. To receive the fake update, the email asks the users to revalidate their log in credentials by inputting them into a website made to look like the software developer\'s portal. The credentials, once collected, are then used to access the tax professional’s account and steal client information.\nAccountants and professional service providers often hold large amounts of personal information on their clients, so are a rich target for criminals seeking to access large amounts of sensitive data in a single attack. This threat is not unique to the U.S; scammers have similarly been seen targeting UK professionals in timely attacks that exploit key deadlines throughout the financial year.\nMeasures are already in place and there is further work underway, as part of the UK NCSC’s Active Cyber Defence programme, to prevent the spoofing of HMRC email addresses in similar UK tax-themed attacks. However, accountants and professional services firms should take mitigative steps to protect client data, as criminals may regard them as less resilient than their banking counterparts, and therefore an easier target.\nThe Cyber Security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) is a great way of learning more about threat information as well as engaging with industry and government counterparts.

180,180,11th August 2017,"['teganography is becoming increasingly popular\nAccording to the cyber security company Kaspersky Lab, steganography is becoming increasingly popular with cyber actors and is used to conceal malware, data exfiltration and for command and control (C&C) communications.\nSteganography is the technique of concealing data within other, seemingly innocuous, information. In a digital context, it generally refers to hiding data within a media file. Image files are the most common, but video and text files are also used. Common ways data can be hidden in a file include altering the image’s pixels in a way indistinguishable to the human eye, or by including information in part of the file format that doesn’t impact the image’s pixels.\nThere are many other ways that steganography techniques are being developed by attackers. Cyber security company, Trend Micro has reported on how exploit kits are using steganography tactics to hide malvertising traffic. In this case, attackers append their malicious code at the end of an image file.\nThe increase in steganography as an attack vector is concerning. Although there are detection tools, they can be expensive and some are not well developed. Due to the ever increasing online social media culture where sharing videos and images is commonplace it is likely that attackers will continue to develop ways of using steganography to facilitate cyber attacks.\nCyber criminal use of cryptocurrency\nCryptocurrencies are decentralised digital cash systems. It’s the lack of a centralised institution monitoring and controlling payments that makes them attractive to criminals. Bitcoin was one of the first examples and employs pseudonymous ‘wallets’ to send and receive this digital money. It was reported this week that the Bitcoin wallets belonging to the WannaCry attackers have been emptied.\nUnlike physical currency, the transaction history of Bitcoins is recorded publicly in the blockchain (the decentralized ledger which tracks and verifies transfers between wallets). Bitcoins obtained through criminal activities can therefore be identified, and many online exchanges will refuse to trade them.\nMixing services are one approach used by cyber criminals to launder their revenues. Bitcoins are sent to a trusted party who receive payments from many different clients, shuffles them around before returning them to different accounts owned by the same customers (after taking a cut for themselves). Just as money withdrawn from a bank will give you different notes from those you paid in, this leaves the criminal different Bitcoins without an apparent connection to the original crime. However, using mixing services is fraught with risk; the service provider may abscond with the payments leaving their customers out of pocket.\nAlthough mixing services are vital to cyber criminals, they are also used by law-abiding Bitcoin users seeking to retain their anonymity, whether because of fears for their safety or a commitment to the ethos of online privacy.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-11th-august-2017

There is currently no evidence to suggest that these incidents are connected but these examples highlight the prevalence of such activity:\nVirgin airlines detected unauthorised 3rd party access to their databases containing employee and contractor data in March 2017, including corporate credentials. In addition, over 100 individuals may have had further details such as social security numbers, driving licences and health related information stolen.\nA hacker claims to have obtained information on over 11 million Spirit Airline customers. The airline notified customers of an incident whereby details including passwords, dates of birth, phone numbers, addresses and email addresses were published online. Spirit stated that the data was acquired from a breach unrelated to the airline. The hacker contacted media organisations claiming to have discovered a vulnerability and attempted to alert the airline. When the airline did not respond they posted the details online. Spirit Airlines claim the individual issued a ransom demand for the data and that it appears to be a collection of details from previous data breaches.\nWestJet airlines have informed customers that an unauthorised 3rd party disclosed Reward members profile information online, although they state that this did not include payment card details.\nAirlines collect a significant amount of customer data and as such can be an attractive target for malicious actors.

Businesses usually quote one large estimate when commenting on a cyber breach’s cost. However, in NotPetya’s wake, some businesses have provided more detailed breakdowns that highlight the attack’s tangible and financial costs.\nThe consumer goods company Reckitt Benckiser says some operations will not be fully restored until next month and partially attributes a fall in sales to NotPetya. FedEx Corp says it may not be able to recover all services in its TNT Express division. Other companies report that the attack will impact upcoming quarterly sales figures.\nThe disclosures come as other high-profile business victims are counting the cost of previous data breaches. The owner of the Ashley Madison dating site has offered $11m to settle lawsuits from US users claiming financial loss and identity fraud from the 2015 breach. Yahoo’s disclosure of a second large data breach delayed the acquisition of its core Internet business by US telecoms firm Verizon, which eventually paid around £280m less than originally agreed. More recently, shares in Italian bank UniCredit fell following disclosure of a cyber breach.\nNCSC/NCA’s report ‘The Cyber Threat to UK Business 2016/2017’ offers advice on mitigating against cyber threats.\nUrsnif now sniffs out sandboxes\nThe banking trojan Ursnif has been updated to include new anti-sandbox features. It can now detect whether a mouse pointer is being moved, helping it to determine whether it is running on a virtual machine or on a real machine operated by a user. It also appears to now be able to extract contacts and passwords from the Mozilla Thunderbird email client. This new version has been seen in a recent Ursnif campaign, but a previously observed version of Ursnif from March 2017 also contained some anti-sandbox functionality.\nUrsnif has existed for several years. Its code was incorporated in the Gozi banking trojan, which itself was spun off into Neverquest/Vawtrak. Its creators have a history of adding new detection-evasion techniques to Ursnif, such as making it one of the first banking trojans to use Tor to hide its communications with command and control servers.\nDespite Ursnif’s advanced evasion techniques, it still relies on phishing emails. Its senders try to bypass spam filters by password-protecting an attachment which comprises Word documents with malicious macros. The email is crafted to trick victim into using a password, included in the email’s body text, to open the attachment.\nIt remains important for members of the public to be vigilant with emails. Organisations can also help to protect themselves with the guidance provided in the NCSC’s ‘10 Steps to Cyber Security’.\nCyber scammers clone university website\nOn 20 July, Newcastle University advised students that it was aware of a website fraudulently using the university’s brand as part of an online scam.\nMarketing itself as ‘Newcastle International University’, the website contains dozens of sub-pages purporting to offer academic programmes. It reportedly encourages prospective students to provide their credit card details to apply for courses. The website also requests personal information including passport numbers and employer details.\nDespite the website’s well-constructed nature and professional finish, there are a few clues that it is a scam. Most (though by no means all) UK universities and higher educational institutions tend to use the .ac.uk web domain, unlike the website. Similarly, its name, ‘Newcastle International University’, is a further clue that it is not affiliated with the official university.\nThis scam targets prospective students, and particularly international students, looking to secure places with UK institutions for the coming academic year. However, it’s not just recruitment scams students need to be aware of when applying for a place at university. Last year, Action Fraud reported a phishing campaign targeting students with the promise of an education grant from the Department of Education.\nSuch scams may indicate a wider trend of global brands, including UK universities, being targeted by cyber criminals. NCSC assesses that this trend is likely to increase in the future.\nMassive data breach in Sweden causes controversy\nSweden’s Transport Agency (Transportstyrelsen, TS) has reportedly suffered a serious data exposure which is likely to include personally identifiable information (PII) and confidential government data. Citizens may be at risk of identity theft, fraud and other criminal activity from malicious actors. The breach was reportedly the result of management errors and inadequate safeguards.\nTS is said to have outsourced its database and network management via IBM Sweden to vendors in Romania and the Czech Republic, with unauthorised and uncleared personnel being given access to vast amounts of sensitive data. Reports claim that the entire database was uploaded by TS to inadequately secured cloud servers and was sent unencrypted to marketers.\nThis incident highlights the fact that outsourcing IT contracts does not also outsource risk. Outsourcing without adequate security safeguards can leave data vulnerable, risking financial and reputational repercussions for both the data owner and the third party. Aggregating vast amounts of data in a single place and storing it in plain text could also provide opportunities for exploitation by unauthorised individuals.\nUK institutions and businesses could similarly be at risk if they fail to adequately protect information. It is essential for data owners to consider the risk to information held across their supply chain.

183,183,21st July 2017,"[""New SMB protocol exploit effective against most windows operating systems\nAn EternalSynergy based exploit has now been developed which can compromise newer (unpatched) versions of Windows. The original ETERNALSYNERGY exploit released by The Shadow Brokers in April exploited an SMB protocol vulnerability, CVE-2017-0143, to allow attackers to inject code onto Windows machines but only worked on versions up to Windows 8.\nA security researcher has now modified and upgraded ETERNALSYNERGY to be able to compromise all supported but unpatched Windows operating systems except for Windows 10. This new exploit code is publicly available to download on GitHub and ExploitDB.\nThis case shows that exploits previously thought to only be effective against older or unsupported operating systems such as Windows XP can be modified to compromise newer and currently supported systems.

This data is then used by criminals to extort healthcare business owners, and to conduct financial fraud and identity theft.\nThe US healthcare sector has previously been targeted by ransomware campaigns, however this attack methodology is more aggressive in nature. Rather than encrypting data and releasing it following payment of a ransom, criminals are stealing sensitive data and in some instances threatening to expose it or sell it, to pressure victim companies to pay.\nFTP is a protocol widely used in the transfer of data and files. However, when FTP servers are configured in a way that enables user authentication with generic usernames and no passwords, it leaves data stored on these servers vulnerable. This was highlighted by research conducted by the University of Michigan in 2015, which showed more than one million FTP servers were misconfigured, potentially allowing unauthorised access to data.\nThe US healthcare sector is singled out in the FBI report as the target of an active criminal campaign, however any organisation storing sensitive data on a misconfigured FTP server could similarly be exposed to extortion or fraud.\nAsian cyber criminals demonstrate ongoing professionalisation\nAccording to a report by security research group Check Point, cyber criminals in Asia are using fake mobile base stations to impersonate legitimate telecommunications companies while conducting SMS phishing (\'SMiShing\') campaigns. Their text messages link to malware dubbed the ""Swearing Trojan"" (due to the profanity included in its code) which steals bank details. It circumvents mobile-based two-factor authentication by replacing text messenger apps with malicious duplicates.\nSMS spam is a lucrative business for criminals in Asia, who can also mount fake base stations in a vehicle and drive through cities. Nearby mobile devices mistakenly connect to the high power signal, allowing the spammers to transmit large numbers of SMS messages, often displaying false sender information, without paying network fees.\nSMS spam is currently less common in the UK and, unlike email spammers, operators rarely operate across national borders due to the cost of sending text messages internationally. Nevertheless, this development abroad illustrates the ongoing professionalisation of cyber crime, and the readiness of criminals to combine existing techniques in innovative ways to exploit their victims. One of the themes over the last year, as reported in the joint NCA/NCSC cyber threat report 2016-17 is that the risk from cyber crime is growing as criminals become more creative.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-14th-july-2017

This followed concerns that the routers had a relatively weak eight-character default password consisting of lower case letters that could be cracked in four days, potentially allowing access to other home devices. Routers supplied by other service providers may also come with default passwords.\nPasswords also featured in Ciaran Martin’s interview with BBC’s Today programme (Friday 30 June, 0810) where he recommended that two-factor authentication be used so that a stolen password is much less valuable to a criminal.\nNCSC password guidance can be found here.\nA portion of Microsoft Windows 10 Source code leaked online\nMicrosoft have confirmed a portion of its source code has been leaked online. The initial source of the leak is unknown; however, the content was posted to Beta Archive, one of the largest online ‘Beta and Abandonware’ repositories for prototype software. The leaked content was 1.2GB in size and has since been removed from the Beta Archive site.\nMicrosoft already shares some of its source code with industry partners and government through its Shared Source Initiative. However, this instance represents an unauthorised leak. A number of theories about who is responsible are currently circulating. Was it one of Microsoft’s trusted partners who already had access to the source code? Or was it a criminal who illegitimately obtained access to the code before leaking it? There is no evidence to confirm either way at this stage. The leak occurred one day after two men were arrested in the UK for unauthorised access to Microsoft’s network, however there is no evidence that these two incidents are related.\nSome reports have highlighted the risks of malicious actors using the leak to identify vulnerabilities in the code before developing exploits to target them. However, when a similar leak occurred in 2004 of Microsoft’s Windows 2000 code, similar claims were made, but did not result in a significant up-tick in related attacks. Also, white hat hackers may use the leaked code as an opportunity to investigate it for vulnerabilities before reporting them to Microsoft for fixing.\nWhile Microsoft has responded to this incident, questions have been raised about how the source code was originally obtained.\nDisgruntled ex-employee conducts Smart Meter Network attack\nA former radio frequency engineer used information about systems he had worked on to disable meter reading equipment at several US water utility companies. The individual has since been convicted of two counts of ""unauthorized access to a protected computer and thereby recklessly causing damage” and has been sentenced to 12 months in prison.\nThis case demonstrates the importance of removing software accesses when dismissing staff and appropriate access management. The software used by the former employee remained on his home computer following termination, he also retained access to default root passwords. Using this he took advantage of his pre-existing network and systems accesses to cause disruption (including changing the password to an obscenity and the code for a computer script to the lyrics of a Pink Floyd song) reportedly out of frustration more than a malicious, destructive intent.\nCritically this was not a sophisticated cyber attack; the perpetrator knew enough about the system to effectively disrupt it with limited cyber capabilities. Appropriate access management is important not only for employees leaving organisations, but also those moving into different departments where their access requirements may change. Lax access management often enables insiders to have greater, more targeted impact against their organisations.\nCyber crime trends and statistics in 2016\nThe FBI have recently published their annual internet crime report. The trending topics for 2016 were Business Email Compromise (BEC), ransomware, technical support fraud and extortion.\nA total of 298,728 complaints were received, with reported losses in excess of $1.3 billion. The FBI estimate that only 15 percent of fraud victims in the US report their crimes to law enforcement.\nThe UK\'s National Crime Agency (NCA) considers underreporting a huge barrier to understanding the true scale and cost of cyber crime. The reasons for underreporting include reputational damage; not knowing who to report the crime to; what constitutes a cyber crime; and being unaware that a crime has taken place.\nAlthough figures in the FBI report are not directly comparable with UK statistics, they do indicate similarities in overall trends such as the increase in ransomware crimes, BEC compromise and technical support fraud.\nNCA has recently published a report highlighting these cyber crime trends as well as an increase in the prevalence of mobile malware. NCA has also highlighted the Internet of Things (IoT) threat as having become more mature in 2016.\nThe UK has also seen an increase in technical support fraud, and British law enforcement and Microsoft have been working together for two years investigating these scams. Criminals will typically trick victims into believing their computers have been infected with malware and then persuade the victim to pay for the problem to be fixed. Sometimes the scam involves a pop-up message appearing on a computer claiming to be ""Microsoft Technical Support"". As a result of the investigation, four UK citizens have recently been arrested.\nThe NCSC has guidance for businesses in understanding the cybercrime model and for members on the public how to protect against cyber crime and what to do if you think you have been the victim of a cyber crime.\nRansomware tool causes widespread disruption\nOn Tuesday 27 June, widespread disruption was caused in Ukraine by a ransomware tool that spread to other organisations worldwide via trusted networks. The ransomware tool, with similarities to the Petya ransomware that first struck in early 2016, was inserted into a compulsory software update for Ukrainian financial and government institutions.\n\nOnce the malware was installed it looked for other systems to exploit using some of the same worm-like capabilities seen in the WannaCry attacks. In addition, infected devices were subjected to a memory and file system scrape to steal credentials which allowed the malware to move laterally through a network even if it was patched against the exploits used. This highly crafted tool was designed to spread rapidly, in some cases overriding the Master Boot Record (MBR) on infected computers and displaying a ransom note asking for payment in Bitcoins. Despite the request for bitcoins it should be noted that the malware does not store a decryption key and as such attackers could not restore a victim’s files following payment; there have been no reported successful decryptions following payment.\n\nThe NCSC announced on Thursday 29 June that while managing the impact to the UK, its experts had found evidence that questioned initial judgements that the intention of this malware was to collect a ransom. The NCSC is investigating with the NCA and industry whether the intent was to disrupt rather than for any financial gain.\nThe malware has spread to a number of organisations worldwide that do business with Ukraine, including Russia’s oil firm Rosneft, Danish shipping concern Maersk and a large UK advertising agency.\nWhilst this latest ransomware infection is more limited in scale than the WannaCry, it is assessed that the success of these two incidents are likely to motivate other actors who aim to cause widespread disruption to employ “ransomware” to do so.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-30th-june-2017
187,187,16th June 2017,"[""Mouseover malware masquerading in Powerpoint files\nAccording to media reports, a new method of delivering malware has surfaced. 'Zusy' malware, according to IT company ExtremeTech, is a banking trojan whose intention is to steal credentials. The reports suggest that simply hovering your mouse over a link will lead to infection without requiring you to click on anything. However, several stages are required to successfully infect a user.\nWhat is interesting about this malware is that the initial infection vector does not rely on Macros or JavaScript to execute its malicious code. Instead, the malware developer has focused on abusing certain features in Microsoft PowerPoint to download and deploy the banking trojan.\nThis malware is initially delivered to users through phishing as an email attachment. Firstly the user needs to click on and open an attachment which displays a PowerPoint slide in slide show mode. A segment of text or a picture on the PowerPoint slide will have a clickable hyperlink. The most common message seen at this time is 'Loading...Please wait'. The 'mouseover' malware will only initiate if the user directs their cursor over the text or picture. A command is then executed which attempts to run an external program such as a PowerShell script. At this point Microsoft's security feature, Protected View, which is enabled by default, will display a warning notice allowing the user to disable the program. If the program is not disabled, it will create a backdoor giving the attacker full access to the victim machine. Users running PowerPoint versions older than 2010 are particularly vulnerable to this type of attack because when they hover over the link the preview window will open automatically without giving them the option to disable the malicious program.\nHistorically malware infections occur when the victim clicks on a suspicious link and general guidance has always advised users to hover over links to check file formats for suspicious executables. Users should continue to remain aware and be vigilant when receiving email attachments.\nAlthough this development is not as alarming as it may first appear, the NCSC assesses that we may see a more sophisticated version of this attack vector in the future. The NCSC recommends that users follow NCSC malware guidance which includes regularly updating antivirus software to reduce the risk of being infected.\nEnterprises that implement Application whitelisting approaches as described in the NCSC Windows EUD Security Guidance will also mitigate current variants of this threat by preventing the malicious scripts and programs downloaded by the malware from running.\nIndustrial Control Systems malware (Industroyer/CrashOverride)\nThe NCSC is aware of open source reporting providing details of malware dubbed as 'Industroyer' or 'CrashOverride', which is reported to be connected with the December 2016 power outages in Ukraine.\nPrevious media reporting suggests that during this incident, cyber attackers compromised parts of the Ukrainian electricity transmission network, resulting in the loss of electricity supply to customers for approximately one hour.\nThe NCSC have published on CiSP details of mitigation strategies to secure networks against these attacks. US-CERT have also published analysis and indicators of compromise.""]",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-16th-june-2017
188,188,9th June 2017,"['Fireball malware\nMore than 250 million computers worldwide have been infected with malicious adware called Fireball, according to recent reporting. Produced by Rafotec, a Beijing-based digital marketing firm, the malware is spread mostly via bundling. That is, when a user downloads a product they want, the Fireball malware is ‘bundled’ in without the user’s knowledge or consent.\nOnce infected, Fireball hijacks the user’s browser, installs extra plug-ins and manipulates the user’s web traffic. By redirecting traffic to Rafotec’s fake search engines, Fireball is able to generate additional advertising revenue for the company. A greater concern is the fact that Fireball can, in theory, be repurposed to serve as a fully functioning malware downloader.\nShould Fireball be repurposed for further malicious activity it could be used to harvest sensitive data, such as financial credentials, medical records, or corporate business plans for example. Whilst estimates are that Indonesia, India and Brazil have the highest infection rates at present, other countries have been impacted.\nIn line with NCSC guidance, make sure you only install software from trusted sources.\nSingle Sign On provider OneLogin is compromised\nIn late May, OneLogin, an online access and identity manager, experienced a security breach where sensitive customer data in its US region may have been compromised. OneLogin primarily provides Single Sign On (SSO) and identity management services for corporate customers using cloud based applications. It is not yet clear how the unauthorised access happened nor the impact, but it is suspected that a threat actor obtained access to Amazon Web Store (AWS) keys and used them to gain access to the AWS Application Programme Interface (API) via another smaller provider in the US. The actor was then able to access database tables containing information about users, apps and various types of keys. This may have included the ability to decrypt encrypted customer data.\nTo minimise damage OneLogin issued advice to customers which included generating new keys, authorisation tokens, security certificates and credentials and updating passwords.\nThis is not the first time an SSO or similar service has been targeted. Although, like password managers, they are increasingly considered to be a better way of managing accesses, they are a tempting target for attackers, and the consequences of compromise can be severe.\nA new variant of Qakbot malware is bringing down enterprise networks\nA new variant of the Qakbot (aka Qbot or PinkSlip) trojan, first seen in 2009, is stealing user information and installing backdoors on Microsoft Windows operating systems. Qakbot malware is used to target online bank accounts of businesses and individuals. Victims are initially infected through an exploit kit, phishing campaign or malicious download.\nThis new variant has worm-like, self-replicating capabilities similar to WannaCry but it is not ransomware and does not encrypt user hard drives. In its attempts to steal or brute force login details it can cause mass Active Directory lockouts. Some organisations have had thousands of users prevented from using corporate systems as a result.\nAccording to researchers, Qakbot code has been totally re-written and is even more advanced and effective. The new features make it difficult to detect by using obfuscating code and constantly evolving file structure and signatures.\nWe assess it likely that other malware campaigns will make use of these antivirus avoiding techniques. Users should stay on their guard against suspicious emails and activity and keep their systems up-to-date to help prevent infection.\nVulnerabilities\nThis week’s summary starts with Google and multiple flaws fixed in both Chrome and Android leading to URL spoofing, obtaining of sensitive information and remote code execution.\nCisco released updates for a number of different products; TelePresence, AnyConnect, Email Security Appliance, Prime Data Center Network Manager, NX-OS, Content Security Management Appliance, and 8800 Series IP phones, to address cross-site scripting, bugs that cause the target to crash, allow unauthorised access or remote code execution.\nIBM released updates for their Security Access Manager Appliance, Spectrum Project (IBM Tivoli Storage Manager) and Domino TLS Server to prevent elevation of privilege, the viewing passwords, obtaining of sensitive information, and obtaining of authentication credentials.\nElsewhere this week there were updates for Wireshark, Apache Tomcat, VMware vSphere and Irssi.\nDebian specific updates this week came from perl, nss and zookeeper.\nICS specific updates for Digital Canal Structural Wind Analysis and Rockwell Automation PanelView.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-9th-june-2017
189,189,2nd June 2017,"['Android app malware\nAccording to IT security company Check Point, as many as 36 million Android devices may have been infected with ad-click malware. The malware, dubbed Judy, is reported to have been present in approximately 50 apps in Google’s play store, but the total number of infections cannot be accurately determined as it is not known for how long the apps have been malicious.\nThose responsible generate money through ad-clicks – in this instance Judy silently imitated a browser and clicked on banners from Google’s ad infrastructure to generate revenue for the malware author. The malware has had little real impact upon the end user, though it does equate to an illegitimate use of a device, and could potentially be exploited for more sophisticated attacks, including: gaining control of devices for additional malware download, conducting DDoS attacks or gaining access to private networks.\nGoogle’s protection system did not immediately identify the problem because the apps themselves did not contain any malicious code. Rather, once downloaded from the play store, the affected apps are designed to call out to a remote server which then delivers malicious ad-click software to devices.\nThis type of two-stage delivery is increasingly common. Last month, FalseGuide malware was discovered hidden inside apps and games on the play store. Following download, these compromised apps allow malicious actors to install additional malicious software. App stores may come under increased pressure to enhance their scrutiny of apps before permitting them to feature, particularly if the number of instances of adware infections increases.\nThe NCSC recommends that users only install apps from the official application store for your device. Malicious apps in official stores are more likely to be discovered, and subsequently removed from the store and the device.\nRoughTed Malvertising Campaign\nThreat researchers at internet security firm Malwarebytes have recently highlighted a significant malvertising campaign, called RoughTed, which has been running for over a year.\nMalvertising (or ‘malicious advertising’) uses online advertising as a delivery method for malware. Malware-infected ads can be inserted into popular, legitimate websites, and often do not require user action to be effective: simply visiting an infected site can be enough to get infected.\nCriminal use of malvertising as a vector for malware delivery has been an increasing trend since it was first observed in approximately 2007 with the exploitation of a vulnerability in Adobe Flash. In 2015 Google disabled more than 780 million ads that violated their policies, some of which carried malware, up from 524 million in 2014.\nRoughTed is notable for its prolific distribution, with associated domains accumulating in excess of half a billion visits in a three month period. According to researchers, traffic diverted to RoughTed-related domains comes from thousands of different websites, some of which ranked in the electronic personal assistant, Alexa’s, top 500 websites. RoughTed can reportedly target a wide array of users according to their operating system, browser and geolocation before delivering a variety of payloads, including exploit kits and malware. Moreover, RoughTed has been circumventing adblockers, broadening the pool of potential victims.\nFor more information on malvertising and how to protect yourself and your business from the threat, read this blog.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-2nd-june-2017
190,190,26th May 2017,"['Criminals target US healthcare sector\nThe cyber division of the FBI recently issued an alert warning of criminal activity targeting File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers operating in ‘anonymous’ mode, associated with the US medical and dental facilities.\nThe criminals involved are reportedly motivated by the potential to access protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII). This data is then used by criminals to extort healthcare business owners, and to conduct financial fraud and identity theft.\nThe US healthcare sector has previously been targeted by ransomware campaigns, however this attack methodology is more aggressive in nature. Rather than encrypting data and releasing it following payment of a ransom, criminals are stealing sensitive data and in some instances threatening to expose it or sell it, to pressure victim companies to pay.\nFTP is a protocol widely used in the transfer of data and files. However, when FTP servers are configured in a way that enables user authentication with generic usernames and no passwords, it leaves data stored on these servers vulnerable. This was highlighted by research conducted by the University of Michigan in 2015, which showed more than one million FTP servers were misconfigured, potentially allowing unauthorised access to data.\nThe US healthcare sector is singled out in the FBI report as the target of an active criminal campaign, however any organisation storing sensitive data on a misconfigured FTP server could similarly be exposed to extortion or fraud.\nAsian cyber criminals demonstrate ongoing professionalisation\nAccording to a report by security research group Check Point, cyber criminals in Asia are using fake mobile base stations to impersonate legitimate telecommunications companies while conducting SMS phishing (\'SMiShing\') campaigns. Their text messages link to malware dubbed the ""Swearing Trojan"" (due to the profanity included in its code) which steals bank details. It circumvents mobile-based two-factor authentication by replacing text messenger apps with malicious duplicates.\nSMS spam is a lucrative business for criminals in Asia, who can also mount fake base stations in a vehicle and drive through cities. Nearby mobile devices mistakenly connect to the high power signal, allowing the spammers to transmit large numbers of SMS messages, often displaying false sender information, without paying network fees.\nSMS spam is currently less common in the UK and, unlike email spammers, operators rarely operate across national borders due to the cost of sending text messages internationally. Nevertheless, this development abroad illustrates the ongoing professionalisation of cyber crime, and the readiness of criminals to combine existing techniques in innovative ways to exploit their victims. One of the themes over the last year, as reported in the joint NCA/NCSC cyber threat report 2016-17 is that the risk from cyber crime is growing as criminals become more creative.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-26th-may-2017

The scale of the outbreak has been blamed in part on the widespread use of unlicensed software. Pirated software is often insecure as it does not benefit from manufacturers’ updates to fix vulnerabilities.\nSeveral of the countries reported by cyber security companies to be worst affected are also amongst the countries where unlicensed software is most widely used.\nThis incident illustrates that while using unlicensed software might be seen as a way of saving money in the short term, it can put cyber security at serious risk and may potentially lead to losses far outweighing any savings.\nThe NCSC's guidance on protecting your organisation from ransomware can be found here.

Investigations indicate that criminals probably accessed credit card and other payment information between 24 March and 18 April 2017. It is currently unclear how many locations and customers were affected.\nAlthough this compromise appears to be linked to the Carbanak group responsible for the theft of over 1 billion USD from 100 financial organisations worldwide, it is also possible that other criminal actors with access to Carbanak's malware could be responsible.\nCriminal actors exploiting Carbanak malware have been responsible for a large proportion of recent payment system compromises. For example more than 20 US-based hospitality companies have been targeted since summer 2016 and hospitality companies in Australia, England and Ireland were victims of similar attacks in early 2017.\nThis activity whether by the Carbanak group or another organisation with similar malware and capabilities, appears to be aimed at companies with a high volume of payment transactions. If the Carbanak group, which previously mainly focused on the finance sector is responsible, it shows the group has now broadened its targeting base to encompass the hospitality and retail sectors too.\nEn Marche phishing attack\nThousands of internal En Marche party documents apparently obtained from a cyber attack were published on the internet on 5 May a few hours before the French campaign blackout deadline, meaning that neither Macron nor his rivals could respond substantively.\n\nThe attack involved phishing which successfully compromised En Marche staff personal email accounts, including the campaign speechwriter’s, when a malicious link - embedded in the email – was clicked. This meant the hackers could take over the email accounts, accessing all the content of the mailboxes.\nOnce they had gained access, hackers could then send emails appearing to be from the respective campaign staff. Sending email posing as trusted staff members could easily dupe fellow campaign workers to click on malicious links thereby giving hackers further access to the contents of mailboxes.\nVulnerabilities\nThe main news this week was the Intel AMT and Windows zero- days, but in addition Microsoft’s regularly scheduled updates fell this week with updates, many rated critical, for all supported versions of Windows and Microsoft Server products, as well as updates for Edge, IE, .Net Framework and MS Office.

193,193,5th May 2017,"['Google and Facebook were victims of Business Email Compromise (BEC) or ‘CEO Fraud’\nGoogle and Facebook have been identified as the victims of an email phishing attack for which a Lithuanian man was charged in March 2017.\nThe attack relied upon social engineering methods rather than technical intrusion techniques. However, the individual was still able to trick the organisations into transferring over $100 million between 2013-2015, highlighting how cyber-enabled social engineering can be effectively used to commit fraud.\nThe individual posed as a manufacturer which both firms had existing business relationships with, and sent emails which were designed to look like they came from the manufacturer. The emails contained forged invoices and contracts which appeared to have been signed by executives. This is less technically sophisticated than some other cases of BEC whereby the third-party supplier’s legitimate email is compromised and used to request transfers. The phishing emails were highly targeted, sent to Facebook and Google employees who regularly conducted multi-million dollar transactions with the manufacturer the scammer was impersonating.\nLarge organisations are especially vulnerable to attacks such as this: often suppliers and individuals have less face to face interaction, and therefore may have reduced opportunities to identify bogus or suspicious transfer requests through conversation.\nFraudulent communication to convince organisations to transfer funds is not new, however it is increasingly common as a low cost, high return crime. Other variations on this attack include\nSpear-phishing emails co-ordinated with phone calls confirming the email request\nImpersonation of trusted partners beyond suppliers, including charities, law firms, think tanks or academic institutions\nImpersonation of fellow employee emails, either through compromising an account, or creating a similar looking fake address\nUse of social media to research or make contact with potential victims\nThe NCSC has previously issued guidance on phishing attacks aimed at senior executives or payment departments.\nFacebook outlines plan to combat information operations\nFacebook has outlined measures to combat “information operations”, which it defines as efforts conducted by organisations, including governments, to spread misleading information and falsehoods to “distort domestic or foreign political sentiment"". Whilst reporting has focused on the potential impact on democratic processes, manipulation of social media could similarly be used to inflict reputational or even financial damage on organisations. An example of this would be the 2013 fake “alert” from one of America’s most trusted news sources, briefly fooling some news outlets into reporting that an explosion had occurred at the White House and causing the Dow Jones to drop 145 points in two minutes.\nFacebook has highlighted that information operations extend beyond the creation of “fake” news stories: other activities such as the dissemination and promotion of stolen information, and targeted data collection on individuals have all been noted. Furthermore, the increased circulation of “fake” news stories to a larger audience is regularly achieved through artificial amplification of posts, whereby paid individuals, often using fake accounts, use techniques such as co-ordinating “likes” to boost the prominence of key postings or creating groups that camouflage propaganda by including legitimate items.\nFacebook has stated that it will mitigate the artificial amplification of fake stories using machine learning and analysis to identify bogus accounts, which will then be suspended or deleted. For example, Facebook suspended 30,000 accounts in France prior to the first round of the French presidential election.\nVulnerabilities\nMainly platform agnostic/cross platform updates this week, leaning towards Linux and Unix based systems.\nIntel released a fix to their Active Management Technology to address a flaw which could allow remote and local users to gain elevated privileges.

For example, by registering the Unicode domain “www.xn--googl-z8a.com” an attacker would be in control of a web address, which will render in browsers as “www.googlė.com”, almost indistinguishable from the real thing.\nMoreover, researchers have recently demonstrated they can use this technique to convert Unicode into ASCII characters in some browsers. By choosing letters from a single foreign language set, an attacker can register a domain that looks identical to a targeted one when rendered by vulnerable browsers. For example, proving the concept, a researcher recently registered the domain name “xn--80ak6aa92e.com”, which renders as “apple.com”.\nMitigations such as using password managers can help users spot fake websites, and therefore help mitigate this threat. In addition, email anti-spoofing measures can help prevent phishing email attacks from reaching users in the first place.\nVulnerabilities\nAn altogether quieter week than we have seen for a while on the vulnerabilities front.

195,195,21st April 2017,"['Hajime – What is the intent of this IoT Botnet?\nIn October 2016 the security research group at Rapidity Networks discovered a new malware, called Hajime, with similarities to the Mirai botnet: it targets Internet of Things (IoT or internet-connected) devices by scanning the Internet for devices with network vulnerabilities and attempts to connect to them using known default username/password combinations. According to Symantec, Hajime is believed to have infected between 130, 000 and 180,000 devices worldwide with Brazil and Iran having the most infections followed by Thailand and Russia. Industry partners have suggested that the number of UK devices infected currently stands at approximately 5,000.\nHajime is being compared to the Mirai malware for a number of reasons including: similarities between initial infection vectors; the targeting of internet connected devices and the use of command and control (C2) servers to communicate and send instructions out to infected devices. Hajime however differs as it adopts a decentralized approach with a Peer to Peer (P2P) model where communication and instructions are passed between infected nodes rather than the more traditional client-server architecture. It is believed that this type of approach makes the malware much more resilient to take down as it does not rely on just one central server to control the malware.\nThe Hajime malware is also different because it doesn’t, as yet, appear to have been used for malicious intent. Researchers have hypothesised that the controllers could be waiting for more devices to be infected before launching an attack. A more recent theory by researchers is that Hajime has been created by ethical hackers who are targeting Mirai-infected devices with Hajime in order to deny the malware of any harmful activity.\nMalware targeting of IoT devices is not new and as these products are becoming more popular amongst consumers, manufacturers and suppliers should be aware of the emerging risks and cyber threats posed when attention is not paid to IoT security.\nSee the NCSC website for guidance on malware prevention.\nInsider steals employer’s proprietary trading code\nA computer engineer has been charged with illegally exfiltrating the proprietary algorithmic trading model code from a global financial services firm headquartered in New York, where he worked. The code is used by the firm to generate income by predicting market movements.\nFrom December 2016 to March 2017, the engineer took steps to obfuscate his presence on areas of the company’s network that he was not authorised to access. He used discrete areas of the network to collect over three million files, including unencrypted portions of the algorithmic source code, before exfiltrating it.\nThe motivation for this activity has not been conclusively reported, nor whether this individual acted alone, or on behalf of another. The tasking of insiders by criminals to exploit access to corporate networks is a common occurrence. But the exfiltration of this particular source code is significant because trading platforms could be manipulated to allow vast amounts of money to be stolen in a single attack. Alternatively the intellectual property (IP) could be sold to a rival company.\nCompanies can mitigate against the insider threat by incorporating security policies that restrict access to the most classified data and installing alerts when unusual activity is taking place.\nHotpoint service site compromise\nRecent reporting by cyber security company Netcraft noted the compromise of domestic appliance manufacturer Hotpoint’s UK and Irish service websites, which has since been confirmed by Hotpoint in a statement via the Register. Customers accessing the service website were reportedly presented with fake Java dialogs, which if clicked, directed users to possibly malicious third party websites, presenting a risk that users could be infected with malware. Netcraft note that the compromise occurred shortly before the Easter weekend, suggesting that this may have been done deliberately to maximise the impact.\nAccording to the company’s statement, no customer data was compromised and the vulnerabilities were quickly resolved. Netcraft suggest that the site’s WordPress installation may have been responsible. The NCSC provides guidance on minimising the vulnerabilities to WordPress, including the recommendation to implement regular security updates of WordPress as well as any plug-ins, only using trusted plug-ins and replacing default or easy to crack passwords.\nVulnerabilities\nThere have been a large number of updates over the last week, thanks in part at least to Oracle’s quarterly update cycle falling this week.

Please see the following report for further details. Further information can also be found via the Cyber-Security Information Sharing Partnership (CISP) forum.\nMedia references to terrorist cyber capability\nThere have been numerous reports on the recently imposed restrictions on electronic devices larger than a smartphone being allowed in cabin baggage on flights from certain countries in the Middle East, North Africa and Turkey. A statement from the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said: ""Evaluated intelligence indicates that terrorist groups continue to target commercial aviation, to include smuggling explosive devices in various consumer items"". This physical terrorist threat to aviation is entirely separate from news reports suggesting a raised cyber terrorist threat against the civil nuclear sector. As highlighted in the recent NCSC/NCA Annual Report, the NCSC assesses that terrorist organisations currently have limited cyber capability. While they may aspire to cause a destructive cyber attack, this remains unlikely.\nMalware Threat to ATMs\nA fileless malware campaign that successfully targeted 140 organisations worldwide earlier this year has evolved. Criminals are now exploiting their remote access to banks\' networks to drop additional malware called ATMitch, enabling them to issue remote commands to compromised ATMs to dispense cash. Banks in Russia and Kazakhstan have reportedly been victims of this malware.\nAlthough we have previously seen cyber-criminals use malware to steal cash from ATMs, their use of a banks\' internal network to remotely deliver ATM malware is a new and more sophisticated form of attack. Also, the use of fileless malware allows criminals to delete malicious commands from the ATM\'s hard drive, removing all traces of an attack.\nThere have been no reported incidents of network-delivered ATM malware attacks against UK ATMs to date. The most common attacks seen against UK ATMs continue to be more traditional physical attacks, which criminals carry out to varying levels of success. For more information on the malware threat to UK ATMs, log in to the Cyber-security Information Sharing Partnership (CiSP) to view our recently published report. Please see details on how to become a member of CiSP.\nRise in compromised websites\nAccording to a recent Google report, the number of websites that were hacked in 2016 was 32% higher than in 2015. Google assess this trend is unlikely to lose momentum ""as hackers get more aggressive and more sites become outdated"".\nAlthough it is difficult to corroborate this statistic or clarify what proportion of the allegedly compromised websites were active, the threat to websites from cybercriminals has definitely risen over recent years, with ransomware and financial scams particularly strong incentives for them to compromise websites in order to facilitate cybercrime.\nGoogle say this problem was compounded by the fact that 61% of webmasters, whose websites were breached had not registered with Google\'s channel for communicating site health alerts, Search Console, and were therefore not notified by Google of the compromise.\nThe NCSC recommend that website owners follow NCSC guidance and regularly patch known vulnerabilities to reduce the risk of a compromise. We recommend that the public follow the malware prevention advice in 10 steps to cyber security to reduce the risk of being infected by malware from infected websites, and you may also find our guidance on designing digital services useful. Following the guidance can help prevent some of the most prevalent types of web attacks that are being carried out currently.\nWebsite owners may also find OWASP\'s Top 10 project, which represents a broad consensus about what the most critical web application security flaws are, useful.\nVulnerabilities\nReports came in this week of a WebDAV buffer overflow vulnerability affecting Microsoft\'s Internet Information Server (IIS). There are reports that this vulnerability is being actively exploited and at the time of writing Microsoft do not yet have a fix available. NIST\'s National Vulnerability Database (NVD) has details. NCSC recommends where there is still a need for on premises installs, that people use the latest versions of software (Server 2016 in this case) as it more secure by default. If we receive more information on this vulnerability we will update accordingly.\nApple released an update for their iOS mobile operating system to fix a bug that could allow remote code execution within Wi-Fi range of the device.\nMcAfee ePolicy Orchestrator fixed a flaw in the anti-malware engine that could allow local users to cause denial of service conditions.

197,197,31st March 2017,"['Criminals target US healthcare sector\nThe cyber division of the FBI recently issued an alert warning of criminal activity targeting File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers operating in ‘anonymous’ mode, associated with the US medical and dental facilities.\nThe criminals involved are reportedly motivated by the potential to access protected health information (PHI) and personally identifiable information (PII). This data is then used by criminals to extort healthcare business owners, and to conduct financial fraud and identity theft.\nThe US healthcare sector has previously been targeted by ransomware campaigns, however this attack methodology is more aggressive in nature. Rather than encrypting data and releasing it following payment of a ransom, criminals are stealing sensitive data and in some instances threatening to expose it or sell it, to pressure victim companies to pay.\nFTP is a protocol widely used in the transfer of data and files. However, when FTP servers are configured in a way that enables user authentication with generic usernames and no passwords, it leaves data stored on these servers vulnerable. This was highlighted by research conducted by the University of Michigan in 2015, which showed more than one million FTP servers were misconfigured, potentially allowing unauthorised access to data.\nThe US healthcare sector is singled out in the FBI report as the target of an active criminal campaign, however any organisation storing sensitive data on a misconfigured FTP server could similarly be exposed to extortion or fraud.\nAsian cyber criminals demonstrate ongoing professionalisation\nAccording to a report by security research group Check Point, cyber criminals in Asia are using fake mobile base stations to impersonate legitimate telecommunications companies while conducting SMS phishing (\'SMiShing\') campaigns. Their text messages link to malware dubbed the ""Swearing Trojan"" (due to the profanity included in its code) which steals bank details. It circumvents mobile-based two-factor authentication by replacing text messenger apps with malicious duplicates.\nSMS spam is a lucrative business for criminals in Asia, who can also mount fake base stations in a vehicle and drive through cities. Nearby mobile devices mistakenly connect to the high power signal, allowing the spammers to transmit large numbers of SMS messages, often displaying false sender information, without paying network fees.\nSMS spam is currently less common in the UK and, unlike email spammers, operators rarely operate across national borders due to the cost of sending text messages internationally. Nevertheless, this development abroad illustrates the ongoing professionalisation of cyber crime, and the readiness of criminals to combine existing techniques in innovative ways to exploit their victims. One of the themes over the last year, as reported in the joint NCA/NCSC cyber threat report 2016-17 is that the risk from cyber crime is growing as criminals become more creative.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-31st-march-2017
198,198,24th March 2017,"['Yahoo breach indictments\nThe FBI has indicted four individuals for unauthorised access to Yahoo’s networks. According to the indictment, two were alleged cyber criminals and two were members of Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) who “conspired to protect, direct, facilitate and pay criminal hackers to collect information through computer intrusions in the USA and elsewhere”.\nThe intrusion into Yahoo’s networks, and the group’s subsequent exploitation of this, reportedly began in 2014 and was still active in 2016. During this time, information from more than 500 million Yahoo user accounts was taken.\nThe two alleged cyber criminals were reportedly directed by the FSB officers on how to avoid being detected by law enforcement, and they tried to hide their activities using methods such as leasing servers in various countries, using virtual private networks (VPNs) and using webmail accounts opened with fake details. This trend was highlighted in the NCSC’s recent “Cyber threat to UK businesses” report, demonstrating how threat actors such as criminals and state actors might work together for mutual benefit. Collaborations such as this may result in the potential ‘upskilling’ of cyber criminals.\nThe indictment states that spear phishing was used to gain access to the networks. Some of the spear phishing emails contained malicious hyperlinks or attachments that directed to malware, while others lured recipients into divulging legitimate login details for their accounts. According to Ars Technica, the FBI have suggested that the initial intrusion likely occurred after the targeting of a “semi-privileged” Yahoo employee, and not top executives. This neatly demonstrates that the most useful staff members for malicious actors to target are often those administrators with escalated levels of privilege and not necessarily the organisation’s most senior staff. The NCSC has issued guidance on the importance of protecting administrators from spear phishing which can be found here.\nAs well as seeking information on topics of interest to Russian intelligence services, such as email accounts belonging to Russian journalists and accounts of US and Russian government officials, the attackers sought monetary gain from the breach. They did this using methods like scraping accounts for credit or gift card numbers, and taking address books from compromised accounts to use in a spam marketing campaign. The indictment does not state how much money was generated from these activities, but it is appears that the Yahoo compromise was used for both espionage and criminal purposes.\nMalware money launderers charged\nMetropolitan Police officers investigating the laundering of money illegally obtained from malware attacks in the UK have brought charges against two London-based Russian nationals. The pair were charged with conspiracy to commit fraud by false representation and with money laundering. They were arrested on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud UK clearing banks of over £2 million.\nCyber criminals will at some point need to launder the proceeds of their unlawful online activities for use in the real world. The process is therefore an important aspect of their activity, and potentially offers disruption opportunities against those hoping to profit from malware attacks.\nLaundering methods include opening bank accounts using false identities and/or documents and ‘cashing out’ the deposited funds through the purchase of high value items, buying foreign currency or simply withdrawing money. Alternatively, the criminals may recruit money mules, individuals hired (sometimes unwittingly) to receive and move illegally obtained money between accounts and/or countries. This offers disruption opportunities against those hoping to profit from malware attacks.\nVulnerabilities\nThis week there were many updates from Cisco relating to different products, from the WebEx Meetings Server, Unified Communications Manager, Unified Computing System Director, Telepresence, Wireless LAN Controller, Prime Infrastructure, Nexus 7000 and 9000 Series, ASR routers, ASA and IOS/IOS XE. These updates addressed a range of problems from remote users conducting cross-site scripting, spoofing devices, modifying the configuration, bypassing the firewall, gaining root privileges, executing arbitrary code or obtaining potentially sensitive information.\nMozilla updated Firefox to fix a vulnerability that existed in version 52, and possibly earlier versions, that could allow for remote code execution due to an integer overflow.\nHPE updated LoadRunner and Performance Center to address remote code execution vulnerabilities, and an update for NonStop Software Essentials to fix an unspecified flaw that could allow for local users to potentially obtain sensitive information.\nQNAP Have released version 4.2.4 to fix multiple flaws that could potentially allow remote users to inject SQL commands, steal cookies, conduct cross-site scripting and clickjacking attacks, obtain potentially sensitive information, and/or execute arbitrary code\nElsewhere this week there were updates from IBM WebSphere, Ettercap, Drupal, Red Hat, EMC RecoverPoint, PuTTY, OpenSSH and for the Linux Kernel.\nDebian issued updates for the Chromium browser, R, sitesummary and Wireshark.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-24th-march-2017
199,199,17th March 2017,"['Ransomware for political ends\nCyber security company PaloAlto networks has recently identified a new type of ransomware, seemingly designed for political ends. Ransomware is generally used by cyber criminals for monetary gain, encrypting data and forcing infected users to pay a financial ransom to decrypt their files. However, in this case, ‘RanRan’ ransomware demanded a political statement in return for the encryption key. The victim was supposed to create a sub-domain of their public-facing website with a defamatory name relating to a political leader, and announce they had been hacked.\nPaloAlto does not provide details of the actor responsible, but notes several mistakes in the ransomware code, as well as the reuse of publicly available source code. Importantly, the ransomware did not achieve its objective in this case, in that the ransom demands appear not to have been met. This represents a novel use of ransomware and an interesting evolution of the threat. Although this iteration was unsuccessful, it is possible that these or other actors may seek to develop more sophisticated ways of achieving political ends through ransomware. The NCSC provides guidance on protecting your organisation against ransomware threats.\nResearchers investigate zero-day vulnerabilities\nRAND Corporation has published a report into zero-day exploits, estimating their lifespan and the likelihood of vulnerabilities being discovered by multiple researchers independently. A vulnerability or exploit is called ‘zero-day’ if it is not yet publicly known, and a patch is not available.\nAnalysing the databases of a security researcher, the study estimates that a typical zero-day will remain viable for 6.9 years. Some exploits were patched after discovery by other actors, while others were fixed inadvertently during routine software updates.\nThe report notes that affordable zero-day vulnerabilities can be bought for almost any target. Since network defenders cannot anticipate the details of such attacks, they may choose instead to accept that occasional intrusions are inevitable, and design networks in a way that minimises the impact of a successful attack through monitoring for suspicious activity.\nMost attacks target well known vulnerabilities on unpatched systems, or socially engineer users into inadvertently compromising their own machines. Regular patching, and the other elements in the NCSC’s 10 Steps to Cyber Security, remain best practice.\nJoint NCA and NCSC annual report launched\nThe first joint National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) and National Crime Agency (NCA) annual report was published this week. ‘Cyber threat to UK business 2016’ provides an in-depth analysis of evolving threats.\nThe report elaborates on five ‘game-changing’ events (the Ukraine power attack, the Bangladesh Bank heist, the DNC hack, the Mirai botnet and the Yahoo! data breaches). It also provides a thematic assessment for industry, drawing out trends of events we have seen in cyberspace and predictive analysis of what could happen over the next 12 months.\nVulnerabilities\nThe main headline this week is the Apache Struts remote code execution vulnerability for which an emergency patch was released last week [CVE-2017-5638].

200,200,10th March 2017,"[""Yahoo breach highlights cookie security issues\nLast year Yahoo reported several data breaches occurring between 2013 and 2016 which affected a large number of user accounts. Personal information stolen could have included email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers.\nFollowing forensic investigations Yahoo has revealed that fake cookies were a probable method used by attackers to access user accounts without a password. According to Yahoo, the attacker was able to create fake cookies by accessing the company's proprietary source code.\nIn response Yahoo invalidated unencrypted security questions and advised affected users to change their passwords. The company also recommended that users adopt its authentication tool instead as it eliminates the need for a password on Yahoo accounts. It is unclear how the fake cookies managed to evade website security but this advice indicates authorisation and authentication issues.\nA cookie is a small file that a website puts on a user's computer to store information, potentially ranging from website links visited to personally identifiable information. Cookies can also be used to store passwords and other login details. They have many functional advantages but if they are not managed correctly with appropriate security measures, attackers may be able to exploit them.\nSee the NCSC's cookie policy for details of how we use them on our website. For further advice on how to manage cookies, visit here.\nData leak reveals spam techniques\nSecurity researcher Chris Vickery has reported that almost 1.4 billion user records from River City Media (RCM) were exposed after being backed up online without password protection. The data has since been taken offline, but it is unknown whether other actors have accessed it.\nUS-based RCM describes itself as an email marketing firm, but is listed in the top 10 of the Spamhaus Register of Known Spam Operations. As a result of the leak, RCM's infrastructure has been blacklisted by anti-spam organisations.\nThe leak also revealed techniques used to force legitimate mail servers to deliver up to a billion emails daily. The sender's computer sends deliberately slow and incomplete requests to the mail server, keeping existing connections open, while opening as many new connections as possible. Once the sender is ready, they resume normal speed requests and use the open connections to send a flood of emails before they can be blocked. This is very similar to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack known as Slowloris, which uses large numbers of slow connections to consume server resources and prevent other users from gaining access.\nUpstream services attacked to target end users card credentials\nA reported security breach at the US retail platform provider Aptos has led to malware infecting machines that the company uses to host online retail services. Forty e-commerce stores using Aptos services are said to be affected by the incident, which allowed malicious actors in some cases to access customer names, phone numbers, addresses, email addresses as well as payment card numbers and expiration dates. The malware is reported to have been present on Aptos systems for up to ten months during 2016. The company is working with US authorities to investigate the breach.\nThis incident illustrates the risk of upstream service and software providers being compromised to reach a broader victim base. A single attack on an upstream provider can deliver a much higher return on investment, compared to attacking each retailer separately. The success of such attacks is likely to encourage cyber criminals to target more upstream service providers.\nIt also highlights that while services can be outsourced, responsibility for customer data ultimately lies with those who collect it. Businesses need to demand high cyber security standards from third party organisations with access to their customer data, including software and service suppliers.

201,201,3rd March 2017,"['Drone-enabled hacking\nAn organisation’s most sensitive information is often stored on ‘air-gapped’ computers, which are physically separated from the internet. The lack of a connection protects them from most external attackers, and even if the machine is infected with malware, the data is difficult to exfiltrate.\nAn Israeli researcher has demonstrated a new technique for transmitting information out of air-gapped computers, using malware to force LEDs to flash in a pattern that can be picked up by a drone hovering outside the window. Other known methods for exfiltrating information over an air gap include varying fan speeds to produce audio signals, and using USB sticks to send RF emissions. LEDs can transmit information at a much faster rate, however, reaching 4000 bits per second with high quality light detection equipment (corresponding to around an A4 page of text every five seconds).\nThis attack requires infecting air-gapped machines with specific malware, and can be mitigated by simply covering LEDs with opaque tape. However, it illustrates the potential for emerging technologies, such as drones, to enable compromises. A potential variation on drone-enabled hacking could involve mounting a Wi-Fi access point on a drone, impersonating a corporate Wi-Fi network, and positioning it in an otherwise secure location. Employees connecting to it would expose devices and company data to the attacker. The NCSC recommends that security scanning tools may be useful to detect and locate unauthorised or spoof wireless access points.\nSHA-1 Collision: Cryptographic standard undermined\nResearchers have successfully manipulated a commonly used cryptographic standard. Google and the Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CW) made the widely expected announcement regarding the world’s first SHA-1 collision on 23 February.\nSHA-1, or Secure Hash Algorithm 1, is a process that provides a unique digital fingerprint for any set of data, whether that be code, a document or a webpage. Any change to the original data, no matter how small, would produce a change in the SHA-1 identifier. SHA-1 can therefore show if data has been tampered with between creator and end-user making it useful for a broad array of security applications such as HTTPS verification, digital document signing, version control and backing-up systems.\nA ‘collision’ of SHA-1 means that two different inputs have given the same output fingerprint, which should be extremely rare. The researchers have been able to manipulate SHA-1 to force a collision 100,000 times more quickly than a brute-force approach.\nGiven the difficulty and cost involved in creating the collision, it’s likely that applying it, or similar methods, for other inputs would only be feasible for determined and well-resourced actors. It can however be seen as a proof of concept for a potential attack vector in future, as computing power increases and costs decrease.\nHypothetically, an actor could forge a SHA-1 certificate for malign code which they had altered from an original legitimate version. A victim’s computer would see their malicious version as being identical to the verified original.\nSHA-1 is already being phased out, and many web browsers will cease support for it in 2017. But its pervasiveness means that the transition will take time, and the risk is only likely to grow in future.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-3rd-march-2017

Through this, he was able to send commands over a two-week period that caused \'significant damage to Georgia-Pacific and its operations\'. Open source suggests that he may have modified Industrial Control Systems pertaining to a quality checking process, which it appears hindered production.\n\nPrivilege misuse by former employees is a significant insider risk as a determined malicious insider may retain valuable knowledge of a company\'s programs and network. Ensuring these privileged accesses are removed significantly reduces the likelihood of this occurring, and requires companies to implement effective identity and access management procedures. The NCSC provides guidance on managing user privileges.\nSupply chain operations through systems administrators\nResearch by security company RSA, taken further by cyber security researcher Brian Krebs, recently identified a ""sophisticated software application supply chain attack"", involving the compromise of event log management software used by systems administrators within numerous organisations, probably including defence contractors, telecommunications companies and financial institutions.\n\nWhile victims have not been identified, the list of organisations believed to be customers of the affected software supplier includes some major UK companies, as well as many US and international organisations.\n\nRSA began its investigation after suspicious beaconing was observed going to a command and control server. Its investigations uncovered a number of victims and ultimately revealed that a legitimate vendor\'s website (and software packaging system) had been compromised for a short period in 2015, causing purchasers and existing users to download malicious, compromised software or software updates, instead of the genuine version. RSA comments that such supply chain operations are effective because they are hard to spot and can provide the attacker with access to a large number of victims.\nSOHO router vulnerabilities\nRouter security is sometimes seen as a low priority, and attackers are seizing the opportunity. SOHO (small office/home office) routers are seen as particularly soft targets by cyber criminals, as they are typically used by small organisations without dedicated security staff. Various exploits can be used to compromise routers, though these are sometimes unnecessary as the default login credentials are commonly left unchanged. A compromised router may allow the attacker to spy on user browsing activity, and could also be used to redirect DNS traffic to a malicious server.\n\nLegitimate DNS servers are a vital part of internet architecture, bridging the gap between human-readable web addresses (such as ncsc.gov.uk) and machine-readable IP addresses (54.192.28.195). A DNS server will accept a web address, and return an IP address which can be used to navigate across the internet to the computer which hosts that website.\n\nA malicious DNS server can redirect web traffic to any location. Attackers can then harvest login credentials by sending victims to imitation websites, enable further exploitation by sending them to pages which will infect their computers with malware, or defraud online advertisers by generating fake click-throughs.\nVulnerabilities\nCisco dominates the vulnerabilities landscape this week with updates for their Email Security Appliance, Web Security Appliance, Intrusion Prevention System, Meeting Server, Secure Access Control System, Identity Services engine, Unified Computing System, Unified Communications Manager and Prime Collaboration Assurance products.

The Centre will work to make the UK the safest place to live and do business online.\n\nIn acknowledgement that Government alone cannot protect the public from cyber attacks, the Chancellor announced the launch of the Industry 100 initiative. Industry 100 will see the centre invite expertise from industry to collaborate with the NCSC in achieving its mandate of enhancing the cyber security of the UK.\n\nA reflection on the diversification of cyber crime\nThe nature of the cyber-criminal threat to the UK is diversifying: highly skilled actors are becoming increasingly competent and targeted in their attacks, while the barriers to entry for less-skilled actors are lowering.\n\nAt the high capability end of the spectrum, banking Trojans are reportedly becoming increasingly targeted, with a focus on financial institutions which offer larger relative rewards than end-user customers. Meanwhile, ransomware attacks are said to be specifically targeting those organisations perceived as being more likely to pay due to their timely requirement to access sometimes time-critical data.\n\nAt the other end of the skill spectrum, individuals with minimal cyber capability can carry out nefarious activities online using Crimeware-as-a-Service tools. DDoS attacks, email compromises, criminal infrastructure and more can be bought or rented at minimal cost. Notably, sites now offer live chats with support agents, and collect marketing information to better understand their customers. This trend risks further normalising low level cyber crime.\n\nThe diversification of the cyber-crime threat poses challenges for law enforcement and security professionals, who will face highly skilled, targeted threats. Simultaneously, resources are increasingly consumed by low-skilled attackers using services offered by more competent actors. Detailed analysis of this changing cyber-criminal landscape will be published in NCSC Assessment\'s Annual Report.\n\nWarning of cyber threat from building owners\nThe US Government Accountability Office (GAO) has warned of the potential threat of cyber intrusions from foreign owners of office buildings. Numerous properties occupied by US law enforcement agencies are owned by firms domiciled abroad, including in China, Israel, South Korea and Japan. Some of the buildings are used for sensitive activities including managing classified operations, hosting data centres and storing high-security material. Most of the agencies were unaware that their buildings were foreign-owned.\n\nThe GAO\'s report highlights concerns from the Department of Homeland Security that ""threat actors could coerce owners into collecting intelligence about the personnel and activities of the facilities when maintaining the property."" This could potentially include exploiting building infrastructure to facilitate cyber intrusions. The GAO recommends that US government agencies should be informed if their buildings are foreign-owned, so that appropriate security measures can be implemented, where necessary.\n\nWhile the report focuses on the threat to official bodies, the concerns it raises may also apply to commercial organisations dealing with corporate-sensitive information. Although there are no reported instances so far of such intrusions taking place in the US or UK, this issue highlights the need for precautions regarding landowners\' access to buildings hosting sensitive activities.\n\nWeaponised Macros targeting Mac users\nSecurity researchers have reportedly identified the emergence of Microsoft Word documents containing malware-infected macros for installing malicious software on macOS devices.\n\nThis technique has been used for some time to infect Windows users with malware. However, it is the first reported in-the-wild instance for Word documents containing malicious macros that execute solely on macOS. When users attempt to open the attachment, they are prompted to enable macros. If macros are enabled the malware executes its payload.\n\nAlthough not a particularly sophisticated attack technique, this methodology has been successful in delivering ransomware and banking Trojans to Windows users worldwide. It looks like Microsoft Word users on MacOS may also now be victim to such attacks. This is a timely reminder that cyber criminals are regularly looking to enhance their pool of potential victims; regardless of software and hardware, users must be vigilant of the risks.\n\nWatering hole attacks infected a larger pool of victims than first thought\nLast week it was reported that the Polish financial sector had been the victim of a malware attack, where the attackers used the web server of the Polish financial regulator as a watering hole.

204,204,13th February 2017,"[""Polish banks in watering hole attack\nThe Polish financial sector has been hit by what is being described as the most serious incident in the history of Polish banking. A web server of the Polish financial regulator Komisja Nadzoru Finansowego (KNF) was probably compromised in early October 2016, but it wasn’t until early February that Polish banks noticed unusual network activity and unauthorised files on several workstations. Investigations revealed that the KNF website had been used as a watering hole and malware downloaded onto the devices of selected users who visited the website, including bank employees. At least 20 Polish commercial banks have been affected.\nWatering hole attacks target websites used by a particular group, organisation or industry. By infecting websites commonly used by these groups, the attackers increase their chances of at least one member of the group being infected with malware. This technique is particularly effective, because while internet users are increasingly wary of unsolicited emails, they are naturally less cautious about visiting legitimate websites.\nCyber jobs boom - Demand for security skills continues to grow\nAnalysis of IT job adverts by the Tech Partnership found an 18% annual increase in demand for cyber security specialists, with average salaries for permanent positions also rising to £57,000. In addition to traditional IT security skills, employers are also increasingly demanding knowledge of topics such as cyber crime and big data.\nMost openings continue to be in London and the South East of England, but strengthening demand in other regions suggests that a broader range of businesses are taking cyber threats seriously.\nInsiders and the dark web\nA recently released study by cyber security companies RedOwl and IntSights identified increased efforts by cyber criminals to recruit insiders with access to corporate networks, using the dark web. The report studied dark web forums over a two-year period, noting a significant increase in discussions relating to insiders between 2015 and 2016. The dark web is reportedly criminals' favoured means for recruiting insiders, due to the deniability and privacy that it offers.\nThere are several main types of insider, including accidental insiders and deliberate insiders. Malicious insiders may act alone based on their individual grievances (whether work-related, personal, financial or ethical) or may be recruited by malicious actors (whether criminal, state or others) through financial incentives or, in some cases, blackmail. Depending on their level of access and knowledge, insiders may carry out a number of functions, such as enabling Computer Network Exploitation (CNE), directly exfiltrating sensitive or commercially valuable data, or otherwise enabling fraud through unauthorised lookups.\nInsiders present a significant threat to all organisations, and the authors note that financial institutions are particularly at risk. One recent example of such a threat may have included the Bangladesh Bank theft, in which authorities suspect that an insider at the bank provided the hackers with technical details about its computer network. An earlier example was the 2013 disruption of a criminal plot to compromise high street banks by exploiting hardware in local branches.\n\nThe NCSC website includes links to the key principles of managing insider risk as well as a previous CPNI study of insider behaviour.""]",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-13th-february-2017

This typically means that not all accounts have to be created by humans. Twitterbots can be used for entertainment, marketing, spamming, manipulating Twitter's trending topics list and public opinion, trolling, fake followers, malware distribution, and data set pollution, among other things.\nA 'Star Wars' botnet of 350,000 accounts secretly infiltrated Twitter in 2013 and has laid dormant ever since. The Star Wars botnet randomly tweeted quotes from Star Wars novels.\nThis comes after the reports in June 2016 that a botnet of 3 million accounts, which was created earlier in April 2014, is responsible for a total of 2.6 billion tweets with a daily activity of 500 million tweets. Volumes of this amount could be used to influence public opinion.\nIt is in Twitter's best interest to monitor accounts and make sure they are legitimate but, with a monthly average of 313 million users, this is almost impossible. Hardware and software is now readily available so that bots can be modified to avoid detection. In the Star Wars example, by tweeting quotes from novels, the bots are able to avoid machine-generated language detection tools.""]",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-27th-january-2017

A more recent report on the most commonly used passwords revealed that ""123456"" was still number one, followed by the \'more complex\' ""123456789"".\nThese reports highlight ongoing problems associated with conventional password policies, which tend to promote the use of complicated passwords that are harder for attackers to discover, but which also place greater burdens on users. This approach may therefore be counterproductive, leading users to opt for simple password strategies, which will also be easy for attackers to guess or brute force. In many cases, imposing technical controls such as blacklisting the most common passwords is a far more effective measure.\nThe NCSC offers guidance on password best practice. We have also recently published guidance arguing against the practice of stopping passwords being pasted, which outlines why this approach is counterproductive.\nMobile forensics company hacked\nThe Israeli mobile forensics company, Cellebrite, reports that it has become the latest in a long line of companies to have its data hacked and published online. Cellebrite is a major supplier of forensic tools to law enforcement and other security organisations worldwide. Cellebrite states that it experienced \'unauthorised access to an external web server\' and that it is known the information accessed includes \'basic contact information\' and \'hashed passwords\'. The company advises users to change their passwords as a precaution.\nThe company\'s investigation is ongoing. Without commenting on the specifics of this case, the compromise highlights the broader issue that companies must ensure that they protect themselves and customers in a way commensurate to the threat that they face and the sensitivity of the data that they hold.

207,207,13th January 2017,"[""The year of ransomware...\n...is how 2016 has been widely described in the cyber security media.\nThere has been numerous UK incidents targeting academia, Government departments, industry, CNI sectors and individual users. Using ransomware as an attack technique has become popular because it is easy to carry out and can be financially lucrative.\nRansomware can infect a system via unpatched software vulnerabilities or duping unsuspecting users into installing the ransomware themselves. Once downloaded ransomware will typically lockdown a system or encrypt data files. A message usually appears with 'helpful' instructions about how to restore the system or data by paying a fee.\nMany victims have paid for their systems or data to be restored. However, there is evidence that despite paying ransoms some victims are still unable to access their data. Although it is a matter for the victim whether to pay, industry and members of the public are encouraged to contact ActionFraud should they see themselves targeted.\nRecently criminals have been targeting departments or individuals within an organisation that are more likely to open an unknown attachment. For example, UK schools were targeted by telephone phishing scams where criminals obtained individual email addresses by claiming to have sensitive documents (e.g. exam guidance) that only the head teacher could view. Human resource departments have also been targeted by spear-phishing emails supposedly from potential candidates containing job application attachments.\nIn 2017 there will most likely be further innovations in ransomware and its delivery as cyber criminals exploit new opportunities. NCSC guidance on how to defend against ransomware can be found here: /guidance/protecting-your-organisation-ransomware\nMongoDB databases being held to ransom\nThis week, security researchers have reported a significant increase in cyber-attacks involving a ransom demand against users of MongoDB: a free open-source database program used by millions of customers, including some high profile companies.\nAlternate to the more common ransomware method of encrypting the victim’s data, this current campaign has seen malicious actors access and copy data held in databases, delete the original data and replace it with a ransom note demanding at least 1 bitcoin (approx. £870) for the data to be returned.\nApproximately 200 MongoDB databases across the world were known to have been targeted at the end of December 2016. But security researchers have now reported a significant increase, with the number of databases attacked spiking from 12,000 to 27,000 in a single day. Malicious actors are taking advantage of companies using default configurations, which do not require password authentication to access databases. We recommend users upgrade to the latest version that requires authentication or enable authentication on older versions.\nOpen source software used by small to large businesses provides a wide target base for malicious actors who can successfully infiltrate them, which can not only be exploited for monetary gain but also commercial intelligence. We also assess that this variation of a ransom attack could be an attempt by malicious actors to circumvent existing joint initiatives between industry and law enforcement that seek to help ransomware victims decrypt data without having to pay the ransom.\nItalian siblings arrested for cyber espionage\nA London-based Italian nuclear engineer and his sister have been arrested on cyber espionage charges in a joint operation between Italian police and the FBI. The pair are accused of using a malware product called EyePyramid to target over 18,000 email accounts, including those of two Italian prime ministers, the head of the European Central Bank, businessmen, bankers, academics, major companies, police officials and even Vatican cardinals.\nThe pair are said to have carried out a cyber espionage campaign from at least 2010 using a botnet to acquire information from people in senior financial political positions. The stolen data was stored on servers in the US that have now been seized by the FBI. The malware reportedly included a keylogger that enabled the suspects to capture usernames and passwords.\nThe campaign came to light after the head of security of the state-owned Italian air traffic services company ENAV received a spear-phishing email. A cyber security company analysed it and found similarities with previous targeted malware campaigns, prompting a police investigation which exposed the suspects’ activities.\nThe suspects’ motives are unclear. According to Italian police, they may have used confidential information to make investments through a company they owned. If so, it would illustrate how criminals can use cyber espionage to engage in so-called “outsider trading” by stealing market-sensitive information which can then be used to generate income.\nVulnerabilities\nMicrosoft has issued its smallest ever Patch Tuesday this week with only 4 bulletins, only two of which were rated critical.

208,208,6th January 2017,"['Vulnerabilities in travel booking systems\nSecurity researchers presented findings at a recent cyber security conference highlighting a range of vulnerabilities in travel bookings systems known as Global Distribution Systems (GDS). GDS are databases used by a range of companies, including travel agencies, airlines, hotels and car hire companies, to hold the travel information collectively known as the Passenger Name Record (PNR).\nResearchers noted that GDS can be accessed in many cases with only a surname and a correct six-letter booking code. Due to weak rules for these codes, and a lack of limits on incorrect login attempts, they are particularly vulnerable to brute force guessing attacks. The code is printed on luggage tags and embedded in QR codes on tickets, so attackers may not even need to guess codes. Further vulnerabilities arise from the wide range of access points into GDS (including third party websites), as well as the existence of weak master passwords.\nResearchers suggest that access to booking data could enable an attacker to cancel or rebook a flight, or use detailed travel itineraries to craft highly tailored phishing emails to passengers. They also claim that theft of passengers’ reward miles through access to GDS is already occurring, though do not provide specific examples.\nThe ability to access and/or manipulate PNR data, which can include emails and payment information, may be attractive to a wide range of actors, including criminals and states. The researchers recommend requiring strong passwords to access GDS as one mitigation, though note that this would require industry-wide agreement. They also highlight the importance of logging in GDS databases to gauge the scale of unauthorised accesses.\nSecurity failings ‘contributed to $81m bank heist’\nNew details have emerged of security failings that allegedly contributed to the $81 million cyber heist at Bangladesh Bank in February 2016. The head of the police investigation into the theft has stated the bank’s IT technicians may have connected its SWIFT international payments system to the Internet while setting up a connection to the bank’s domestic payments system. The technicians reportedly also left a hardware token inserted in the server for months at a time, though it should have been removed and stored securely after business hours each day. Earlier findings from a Bangladesh government inquiry indicated further failings such as technicians disabling antivirus software and staff keeping a “secret notebook” of login IDs and passwords on the system.\nThe hackers injected six types of malware which captured keystrokes and screenshots. They were able to delay the detection of the fraudulent transactions, which required both token and password authentication. The investigators suspect that an insider at the bank provided the hackers with technical details about its computer network, as the malware was customised for the bank’s systems. The reported findings highlight the need for well-secured management terminals, and for staff managing sensitive systems to follow established security protocols and avoid taking risky shortcuts.\nRansomware infects smart TV\nThe downloading of an app advertising free movies over Christmas left a family’s smart TV unable to display anything other than a ransom note. The ransom message purported to come from the FBI’s cyber crime unit and demanded $500 to restore the use of the TV.\nThe TV appears to have been infected by a variant of ransomware called “Cyber Police” also known as “FLocker” and “Frantic Locker”. This incident, like the Mirai malware that has been exploiting remote cameras and other connected devices to carry out DDoS activity, shows that cyber criminals are increasingly targeting IoT devices.\nAs more devices are produced to be internet-enabled, manufacturers need to ensure that they are developed with appropriate security measures.\nThis particular incident did have a happy ending as the TV manufacturer provided instructions on how to carry out a factory reset to restore the TV.\nUS indicts suspects in ‘outsider trading’ case\nUS Federal authorities have indicted three Chinese men for stock market trading using inside information obtained by hacking attacks on New York City law firms. Prosecutors allege that the men, from Macau and mainland China, employed malware for about 18 months to access emails from lawyers working on corporate mergers and acquisitions. They used stolen confidential information to make over $4 million trading on firms that were about to undergo mergers.\nThe case has raised the profile of so-called “outsider trading”, where criminals obtain inside information through hacking to make money through financial trades. It is not the first incident of its kind. In 2015, US authorities indicted dozens of people based in the US, Russia, Ukraine, Malta, France and Cyprus. Ukraine-based hackers had reportedly used malware, spear phishing, brute force attacks and other methods to access the systems of business press release distribution services and obtain market-sensitive press releases before publication. They sold the information to corrupt traders in exchange for fees and a percentage of over $100 million in trading profits amassed over five years.\nThe 2015 case may have inspired similar hacking attacks against law firms. According to the business risk intelligence firm Flashpoint, they have been seen as soft targets because of poor cyber security regimes. New York State has recently issued new regulations – the first in the US – requiring banks, insurers and third-party vendors, such as law firms, to improve their cyber security with effect from March 2017.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-6th-january-2017
209,209,16th December 2016,"[""Successful take-down of DDoS for hire service\nRecent joint international law enforcement operations have resulted in the arrests of 34 suspected users of for-hire Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack services. Twelve of the arrests were made in the UK, following a National Crime Agency (NCA)-led operation. The operation targeted Netspoof, an organisation which offered stresser packages to disable web servers and websites by flooding them with enormous volumes of internet traffic. Stressers and booters are tools for stress testing servers which can be misused to conduct DDoS attacks. Netspoof offered attack services for as little as £4.\nDDoS-for-hire is a growing threat, accounting for an increasing proportion of DDoS attacks reported to law enforcement. The availability and low cost of these services is attractive to both novices and professional cyber criminals. Motivations for DDoS attacks include extortion, commercial advantage, reputation building, curiosity and simple malice. Disruption to a company's website can result in potential loss of revenue, additional cyber security costs and reputational damage.\nUkrainian critical national infrastructure targeted in destructive cyber attack\nIt has been reported that Ukraine’s finance and banking system was severely disrupted following a cyber attack on the 6th December. The computer networks of the Ukrainian Finance Ministry and Treasury were both impacted. Payment systems were disrupted for two days and payments were suspended on 7th December. The incident is the most serious reported destructive cyber attack in Ukraine since a December 2015 cyber attack against electricity providers in western Ukraine left parts of the country temporarily without electricity.\nIn both incidents, critical national infrastructure was targeted using Killdisk malware, which destroys data, files and computers and renders operating systems unbootable. This is significant as it appears that, unusually for an attack against the banking industry, there is no reporting of money being stolen but rather that the aim was to have a destructive effect.\nSWIFT Warning\nSWIFT, the global payment messaging system, was reported to have recently warned users of an increased cyber threat to its systems, describing the threat as 'very persistent, adaptive and sophisticated - and here to stay'.\nIn October 2016, an average of 26 million messages were transmitted between financial institutions via SWIFT per day. The system is an attractive target for actors seeking to fraudulently access vast amounts of money, as evidenced by the theft of $81m from Bangladesh Central Bank in February this year.\nSWIFT's message highlights the continuation of the threat to customers as threat actors are said to be 'suspected of trying to replicate the modus operandi of the Bangladesh attackers'. SWIFT reportedly stated that attacks had evolved, with attackers refining their methods following a tightening of SWIFT’s security after the February attacks.\n2013 breach of one billion Yahoo account details\nYahoo has said that, in August 2013, an unauthorised third party stole data associated with more than one billion user accounts, making this the largest data breach reported to date. Yahoo believes that the breach is separate from the incident which impacted 500 million user accounts, disclosed on September 22, 2016.\nThe stolen data reportedly included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords and, in some cases, encrypted and unencrypted security questions and answers. There is no suggestion that passwords in clear text, payment card or bank account details were stolen.\nBreached data is often sold on the online criminal marketplace. Personal data can be used by criminals to access other accounts held by the victim, or even to create convincing phishing emails. Yahoo customers who use the same passwords and security questions for other accounts should change these immediately.\nFurther advice about resetting passwords can be found on the Cyber Aware website, and practical advice relating to the Yahoo breach is available at the Action Fraud website.\nVulnerabilities summary\nMicrosoft released twelve updates this week, including CVE-2016-7279 (<https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms16-145> , <https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/ms16-144> ), which was found and disclosed by the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Six were rated critical and six important. These updates affected all supported versions of Windows as well as Internet Explorer and Edge browsers. Several of these vulnerabilities had previously been disclosed but were not known to have been used in attacks.\nApple fixed 97 vulnerabilities in total across macOS/OS X, iTunes, Safari and iCloud, along with additional updates relating to their iOS mobile platform.

210,210,9th December 2016,"['Infected routers vulnerable to further attacks?\nA small number of TalkTalk and Post Office domestic Wi-Fi routers are reportedly vulnerable to a new variant of the Mirai malware known as ‘Annie’. The denial of service experienced by TalkTalk and Post Office customers last week is said to have been an unintended consequence of the attacker, who goes by the name ‘BestBuy’. The attack sought to infect vulnerable routers with ‘Annie’.\nRecently, BestBuy also claimed to have set up a server to push out malicious firmware updates to Annie-infected/vulnerable routers. Firmware is software embedded within the router, enabling it to function. By pushing out malicious firmware updates, BestBuy claims to be able to lock out ISPs and home users, effectively granting persistent access to the router.\nTo date, there is no evidence of these infected routers ‘in the wild’. However, it is interesting to consider the motivations behind this activity. BestBuy could be seeking to grow the botnet, and is potentially doing so in a way that prevents others from infecting devices with their own malware variants.\nOn a separate note, a security researcher has raised concerns that TalkTalk router credentials could be stolen by attackers, using a ‘GetSecurityKeys’ request. This request returns information on the service set identifier (SSID) codes and the media access control (MAC) addresses, which could be used to reveal the physical location of routers. Router passwords could then be used to access the Wi-Fi network, should someone travel to the identified property.\nCloudFlare notes unusual new DDoS activity\nAccording to security firm CloudFlare, a large distributed denial of service (DDoS) attack was identified and dealt with, with no impact to customers, by the firm\'s mitigation service. The attacks started on 23 November and ran until 2 December, with the attacker working approximately 8 hours a day (from 1300 to 2100 EST) until the last day when the DDoS lasted a full 24 hours.\nThe attacks were concentrated largely on the west coast of the United States, with CloudFlare surmising the targets were ""gaming sites and virtual goods sites and services"". The attacks peaked around 400 Gigabits per second (Gbps) on the first day and went over 480 Gbps on the third day. CloudFlare noted that the attacks were not coming from the Mirai botnet but were launched by a different tool aimed at the Transmission Control Protocol.\nCloudFlare has not indicated who the attacker might be, but noted the pattern of attacks was unusual. The eight-hour shifts imply a highly professional threat actor and could be indicative of organised crime, state actors or hacktivist groups. Kaspersky Lab\'s IT Security Risks study in 2016 suggested that DDoS appealed to criminals as a smokescreen for other criminal activities. When businesses were victims of cyber crime, DDoS was frequently used as part of the attack tactics.\n‘Avalanche’ cybercriminal network arrests\nA major cyber crime network, responsible for hosting and distributing up to 20 different types of malware over several years, has been dismantled by a joint international law enforcement operation.\nThe group, known as ‘Avalanche’, operated one of the largest botnets in the world, using up to half-a-million infected computers on a daily basis. This distributed cloud-hosting network was used by cyber criminals to host malicious infrastructure and deliver malware, such as banking trojans and ransomware, through phishing emails. The network was especially resilient as it used a fast-flux technique which allowed attackers to hide behind an ever-changing network of compromised computers.\nA four-year investigation, involving agents and prosecutors in over 30 countries, including the UK, resulted in five arrests and servers supporting Avalanche being seized or forced offline. Law enforcement used ‘sinkholing’ to infiltrate the network, a technique which redirected Avalanche internet traffic to law enforcement-controlled servers. Europol said this operation marked the largest-ever use of sinkholing to combat botnet infrastructures and the National Crime Agency reported that 830,000 malicious web domains connected to Avalanche\'s activities had been taken down, over 2000 of which had .uk addresses.\nThe long-term effectiveness of such operations is difficult to predict due to the motivations and resilience of cyber crime groups. We do know, however, that those operations which combine arrests and infrastructure seizures with malicious domain take-downs have the best chance for sustained impact.\nVulnerabilities\nLinux and Unix-based systems, among others, received mainly platform-agnostic/cross-platform updates, with no single sector being identified as disproportionately impacted this week. It has been a relatively quiet week with no major vulnerabilities to report.\nMozilla fixed a use-after-free vulnerability in Firefox which could allow a remote user to execute arbitrary code on the target user’s system (a remote code exploit or RCE for short). Fortinet updated FortiGate and FortiOS to fix a problem whereby a local user could obtain hashed passwords on the target system.\nFreeBSD saw a couple of different updates to prevent elevation of privileges and bypassing of security controls, while Apache fixed a problem in HTTPD & HTTP/2 header processing which could lead to excessive resource consumption. There were also updates from Xen, SPIP, NetApp, b2evolution, IBM iNotes and BMC Patrol.\nA variant of a previously fixed Apple iOS buffer overflow vulnerability is still awaiting a fix.']",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-9th-december-2016

The attack resulted in customers being unable to connect to the Internet. This was followed by reports on Thursday 1st December that 100,000 Post Office customers had been similarly impacted as were UK customers of the Internet Service Provider (ISP) TalkTalk. The attack used the Mirai code, which scans and comprises IoT devices using default passwords, and combined it with an exploit allowing it to scan for routers with the remote code execution vulnerability TR-069. The recently published vulnerability, resulting in affected routers leaving Internet port 7547 open to external connections, was also linked to an attack against Irish telecoms company Eircomm.\nThe Mirai worm has previously been associated with other DDoS incidents such as the October attack of DNS provider Dyn which caused several website outages. The Mirai source code was subsequently published online, making it available to numerous actors to use as an attack methodology.

The attacker also threatened to expose 30GB of data allegedly obtained from the SFMTA network during the attack. However, this threat remains unsubstantiated as a spokesperson for the agency confirmed that no data had been accessed from their servers.\nThe ransomware attack caused several of the light rail\'s ticketing kiosks to become unavailable, forcing the agency to offer free travel for much of the weekend to minimise disruption to customers. SFMTA reported that the attack had no impact on transit services; however, the agency did lose a weekend of ticket revenue as a result.

Once an attachment is opened the attackers can move through a bank’s network and gain access to the servers that control the ATMs. The machines can then be remotely programmed to issue cash.\nCriminals have traditionally installed additional hardware to record PINs and skim cards in order to steal money from ATMs, but these methods require physical access to the machines. With this new approach attackers can remotely programme ATMs to issue cash and arrange for ‘money mules’ to collect the money.\nThis method is attractive because an attack can be conducted quickly and, as it targets the contents of the ATM rather than individuals’ customer accounts, the rewards can potentially be much more lucrative. Similar attacks were observed earlier in 2016 on banking systems in Taiwan and Thailand.\nLinkedIn falls foul of data localisation legislation\nThe American business networking site LinkedIn has been blocked in Russia for breaching data localisation legislation, which requires all companies to store Russian citizens’ personal data in Russia. The vast majority of companies, including Apple and Booking.com, comply with the data localisation legislation. The US has called for this block to be lifted and has expressed concern that the case could set a precedent for further sites to be blacklisted.\nIt is reported that LinkedIn was deemed “violators of the rights of personal data” for processing the IP addresses of all visitors to their site, including those who were not LinkedIn customers as well as for failing to store Russian citizens’ data locally. In a statement the Kremlin outlined that it expects the LinkedIn dispute to be resolved and for full access to the site to be restored. A Kremlin aide further commented that Russia’s law on personal data may need to be amended as the definition of personal data was unclear.\nThe outcome of the dispute may set a precedent for other organisations currently deemed not to be compliant with Russian data localisation laws, including Facebook and Twitter.\nVulnerabilities\nThis week sees updates from Symantec for their Endpoint Protection product, a number of different updates from VMware for vCenter, vSphere and vRealize Automation, updates for Cisco Email Security Appliance, ASA and ASR devices and their Unified Communications Manager.

The Carbanak gang were first identified by Kaspersky and are best known for a campaign in 2014 where they allegedly stole $1 billion from over 100 financial institutions worldwide. Security researchers at Trustwave have reported that Carbanak are now targeting the U.S. hospitality and restaurant industry’s point of sale systems.\nThe campaign involves elaborate social engineering whereby the attackers place calls to a customer support centre claiming they are unable to access the online reservation systems and request to send their details by email instead. The attacker then stays on the line until the email is opened and the malware delivered. The email contains a Word document which when opened delivers malware capable of stealing system information, taking desktop screen shots and downloading additional malware which allows the attackers to access the card holder data environment.\nWhilst Trustwave have only reported the attack affecting two U.S. based businesses, organisations should remain vigilant to social engineering techniques and be aware that cybercrime can include a human element, such as a phishing call.\nFinnish DDoS attack shuts heating down\nAccording to Finnish media, residents in two buildings in Lappeenranta, Finland, spent several days without heating as a result of a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack in late October and early November.

In a recent Building Operating Management survey, 84% of respondents said they had BAS connected to the internet. 78% of facility managers also described themselves as having no, or limited cyber security awareness.\nThe cybersecurity of BAS relies on a comprehensive approach: designers, installers, software vendors, building owners and users should all understand the risk.

The report, cited in Network World, predicts that the trend will not only continue this year but may involve more significant incidents due to the emergence of new tools such as Internet of Things (IoT) botnets.\nThe report notes that DDoS attacks in general have been on the rise, increasing by 71% compared with the previous year. While some types of DDoS (such as Network Time Protocol) have been declining, IoT botnets are a growing trend. One such example, the Mirai botnet, has recently been used to conduct some of the largest DDoS attacks ever, such as those against the Domain Name System provider, Dyn, and the blog of the security researcher Brian Krebs, as previously reported on the NCSC website.

214,214,11th November 2016,"[""Threat assessment and trend analysis\nOld Tricks, New Bot\nIn September, the National Cyber Security Centre was made aware of a new banking Trojan called TrickBot, targeting the customers of online financial institutions in Australia and New Zealand. The latest version has added functionality and has primarily targeted the UK. Once infected, the attackers use web browser injects and redirection attacks to harvest banking credentials. TrickBot is distributed through both malvertising and spam campaigns directed at businesses; it seems to be targeting the users of corporate online bank accounts.\nThough sophisticated, these tactics aren’t new. Nor, according to security company Fidelis Cybersecurity, are the tactics alone in being re-used. The code reportedly bears striking resemblances to Dyre, the banking Trojan that successfully targeted large numbers of UK devices and disappeared in November 2015 following a Russian law enforcement raid.\nFidelis Cybersecurity suggests that that some of Dyre’s creators may have been subsumed into the new TrickBot team. It is also possible that the TrickBot group may have obtained the Dyre source code. At this stage it is unclear which, if either, is true.\nTrickBot now appears to be fully operational; we assess it is likely that we will now see an increase in infections of this Trojan, filling the gap left by Dyre.\nBackups limit the damage from ransomware\nRansomware is a growing global cyber security threat that can affect any organisation without appropriate defences. A number of UK public sector organisations have been affected over the last year and have experienced impacts on their services either directly or indirectly through the mitigations needed to handle the incident.\nThe NCSC is aware of recent open source reporting highlighting an example of how a victim organisation was able to restore its systems thanks to data backup procedures. While restoring the data reportedly still took several hours, the impact would have been far greater had there been no backup in place. Following the incident, the victim increased the frequency of its backup schedule from daily to hourly.\nThe NCSC website provides guidance to protect against ransomware </guidance/protecting-your-organisation-ransomware>. While organisations should ensure they have fully tested backup solutions in place in order to limit the impact of a ransomware infection, backups should be considered a last resort. Ransomware is one of many types of malware, and the methods for its delivery are common to most other types. As such, it is important that backups are implemented in conjunction with strong enterprise security, in order to reduce the chances of infection in the first place.\nProliferation of fake retail apps\nThe New York Times reported that hundreds of fake retail apps had been discovered in recent weeks on the Apple iStore. The malicious apps began to appear as the retail sector started to gear up for the Christmas shopping season. It can be difficult to identify the apps as they often look almost identical to the legitimate app, and in some cases there is no legitimate app to compare them to. Malicious apps can pose a risk to consumers who are encouraged to enter their bank credentials, which are then stolen. Apps can also contain malware such as spyware, designed to harvest personal credentials, and ransomware, which locks a victim’s phone.\nMany app stores have screening policies in place, but these are often designed to catch malware rather than fraudulent apps. Apple stated that it had removed the offending apps and that there was a process in place for consumers to flag fraudulent apps. However, this example highlights that cyber threats can impact all businesses, even those which do not currently have an online or app offering, as criminals can exploit their brand, resulting in reputational damage.\nEnterprises may wish to consider limiting the apps their users can download to those that have been pre-approved, while consumers should consider the reputation of any new app before installing it.\nVulnerabilities\nMicrosoft’s monthly Patch Tuesday was this week, so Windows and other Microsoft products dominate this summary. Microsoft released fourteen security bulletins for November, six of which were rated 'critical' and the remainder 'important'. All supported client and server versions of Windows are affected by at least one critical bulletin. In addition to Windows itself, Microsoft published updates affecting Microsoft Edge, Microsoft SQL Server, Office and other Microsoft products. In total, Microsoft patched 68 vulnerabilities, of which two were known to be being exploited.\nAdobe released updates to Flash Player and Connect to fix ten vulnerabilities.\nUpdates were also released by Google for their Chrome browser, by Norton to fix an issue in their mobile security product, and for Citrix, Docker, Sophos, HPE, IBM and Cisco products.""]",['Cyber threat'],https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/report/weekly-threat-report-11-november
215,215,4th November 2016,"[""The use of social media for cyber-enabled fraud is on the increase\nSocial media is increasingly used to commit cyber-enabled fraud according to recent reporting (by cyber security company Easy Solutions). Many of the 80 million fake social media profiles are reportedly used to facilitate cyber attacks. According to cyber security company, Proofpoint, 19% of accounts with top global brands are fake.\nSocial media attacks also recently tricked major UK banks’ customers into revealing credentials by using profiles claiming to be the banks’ customer support. Moreover, Proofpoint reports PayPal customers were similarly targeted over the summer when a promoted tweet on Twitter, claiming to provide PayPal account verification services, was instead a phishing tweet designed to steal users’ bank details.\nSocial media phishing doubled between Q2 and Q3 2016 (according to the Malwarebytes blog) and, as social media is now an integral part of many organisations' customer services, it is likely that this trend will continue.\nVulnerabilities\nThe highest priority update this week is the Windows kernel zero-day bug disclosed by Google. This elevation-of-privilege vulnerability is known to be being exploited in the wild and, combined with CVE-2016-7855, an Adobe Flash Player vulnerability, is able to bypass security restrictions and execute arbitrary code. Microsoft has said they will release a patch for this next week.\nThere is the update to the Adobe Flash Player vulnerability referred to above. There is also an update to BIND, a number of updates for Apache’s Tomcat, an update for Django, updates for Palo Alto’s PAN-OS, Cisco Web and Email Security Appliances.\nMore details are now known about the Joomla! vulnerability from last week and this has been included in our detailed weekly summary on CiSP.\nPlease log in to CiSP for more information on all of these issues.

216,216,28th October 2016,"['Malware-infected ATMs compromise Indian debit cards\nIndian media have reported that 3.2 million debit cards may have been compromised by ATM malware in what has been described as the “biggest ever cyber security breach” in the Indian banking sector. The Economic Times reported that debit cards belonging to large banks such as the State Bank of India (SBI), HDFC Bank, Yes Bank and ICICI Bank may have been compromised.\nAlthough some reports indicate that the breach may have occurred in Hitachi Payment Services systems, this has not been confirmed. The National Payments Council of India (NPCI) has launched a forensic audit on Indian bank servers and systems in order to establish the origin of the attack. In addition, the State Bank of India has re-issued 600,000 of its debit cards, and other banks have recommended that customers reset their PINs.\nThe compromise follows a recent report by Kaspersky Lab indicating that ATM machines were vulnerable due to their outdated communication standards. The report highlighted that 95% of the world’s ATMs, including many in the UK, run on the now unsupported Windows XP. However, as most ATMs in the UK connect to their Bank Driving Software using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) and run hardened versions of Windows, this makes them harder to exploit.\nWe assess that whilst this is not the first time that ATMs have been targeted, the use of malware as an attack vector has been significantly less common than physical attacks using external skimmers and cameras that copy a victim’s PIN. The apparent success of this attack may therefore encourage other criminals to move away from physical attacks to cyberattacks on ATMs.\nPager Vulnerabilities in ICS\nMuch has been written about the vulnerabilities in Industrial Control Systems (ICS), which operate many critical processes and services, such as electricity generation and water treatment. Many publications have focused on the dangers of exposing ICS to the internet, but Trend Micro has recently published a research paper about the widespread use of unsecured, wireless pagers in ICS environments. Trend Micro\'s research involved collecting pager messages using software-defined radio (SDR) and a USB dongle. During a four month period, Trend Micro claim to have observed messages containing information about malfunctioning critical systems, a large quantity of messages sent by a Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) system, and over a thousand email addresses from the email-to-pager gateway of a large defence contractor.\nThis information would be useful to hackers by providing them with information about critical systems useful for attack planning; names, email addresses and other targeting information useful for spearphishing campaigns; and information which could be used to spoof pager messages. Trend Micro noted that it was ""trivial to inject counterfeit messages into the paging systems"" they had monitored.\nThe NCSC believes pagers are not in widespread use in UK ICS environments. However, there are still lessons to be learned for the UK sector: it is important that security leaders of industrial organisations think carefully about all methods of communication used in these settings, not just internet connections.\nVulnerabilities\nThe main headline this week is the so-called ’Dirty COW’ elevation of privilege vulnerability [CVE-2016-5195], affecting Linux distributions going back 10 years. NCSC recommend patching this as soon as possible. An NCSC advisory was issued on 25 October 2016.\nThe content management system Joomla! released a new version to address critical vulnerabilities.\nA large number of updates were provided by Apple this week, fixing critical vulnerabilities across OS X, Safari and iOS. VMware released updates for VMware Tools and VMware Fusion running on OS X. Mozilla provided an update for their Firefox browser, to fix remote code execution bugs amongst others.

217,217,24th October 2016,"['Threat assessment and trend analysis\nOnline Shoppers getting more than they bargained for.\nA recent study has revealed an increase in the number of e-commerce websites infected with card-‘skimming’ malware.\nAttackers have reportedly been exploiting unpatched software vulnerabilities in commonly used e-commerce software to modify the site’s source code. The modified JavaScript code then exfiltrates card details in real-time. These details are transferred to an off-shore collection server, with both the customer and merchant typically left unaware. Skimmed credit card details are often then sold on the Dark Web for approximately £24 a card.\nOnline skimming is a new form of card fraud which is a rapidly growing trend. It is reported that an initial scan of 255,000 online stores worldwide identified 3,501 infected sites in November 2015. Ten months later the number of compromised sites had risen to 5,925. The list of compromised sites is diverse, with a number of UK sites reportedly victims of this attack methodology. The capability of the malware used in these attacks has also developed. In 2015 all reported cases involved minor variations of the same code base. However, a number of distinct malware families are now said to have been identified.\nDue to the low sophistication, low cost and quick financial returns, we assess it is likely card skimming will continue to grow in popularity among cybercriminal groups.\nBanks under-reporting cyber incidents\nAccording to reporting, the number of cyber attacks on UK banks is increasing, yet this is not reflected in the number of incidents reported to regulators.\nUK Financial Institutions are not legally bound to report all cyber incidents to their regulators; the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) requires only events which have had a material impact to be reported. However, it is claimed that this is allowing banks to limit the number of incidents they publicly disclose. Commercial disadvantage and fear of punishment are some of the reasons stated for this self-limiting disclosure.\nHowever, valuable lessons are routinely shared between financial organisations. The global banking system is heavily interconnected, with the security of individual organisations integral to the efficient functioning of the sector. Information sharing on threats, vulnerabilities and attack methodology is necessary to enhance the collective resilience of financial institutions and other vital sectors, more widely.\nTargeted Advertising – protecting our personal data\nWe are all using services seemingly for free; services such as social media platforms, free wifi and even those handy Apps that provide a torch or compass on your phone. However, users may not be aware that they are paying for ‘free’ Apps with their personal data.\nThese companies mostly make their money by selling data about the user, so that advertisers can be smarter about how they use their budget and reach their target audience.\nThe internet advertising industry is massive; digital advertising spending in the UK has grown 800% in the last ten years to over GBP 7bn and accounts for 40% of all advertising share. Mobile advertising is 23% of all digital advertising and is growing fast. Social media advertising alone is around GBP 1bn.\nTargeted advertising allows advertisers to reach a specific group of potential customers without wasting money, time and effort on those outside their target demographic, They are able to do this because website, mobile Apps and communication service providers sell them not only the space to advertise but also the attributes of the audience; this could be age, gender, ethnicity, location and even likes and dislikes.\nWhile this might seem harmless or even beneficial, cybercriminals could potentially exploit this personal data, if not well secured, for identity theft or to socially engineer further targeted attacks. To mitigate the risk it is prudent to be aware of what you are allowing your service providers to access, obtain Apps from reputable sources, evaluate the permissions that they request, and only allow access to personal data if necessary.\nVulnerabilities\nIoT botnets take down US DNS services\nOn Friday 21 October, several US websites including Twitter and PayPal were taken down by a DDOS attack against the Domain Name System (DNS) provider, Dyn. Because many companies globally use the services provided by Dyn, they may have been impacted without necessarily being the intended victim.\nIt was reported that the Internet-of-Things (IoT) botnet known as Mirai was involved in the attack, though this may only have made up portion of the actual DDOS traffic. IoT botnets are growing trend with many household ‘smart’ products operating using default username and passwords. Specific malware scours the internet to seek out and spread to potentially millions of unsecured devices, which are then used to launch DDOS attacks such as this.\nWhile the internet is by its nature resilient and carries significant redundancy, this flexibility disappears if sites depend on single platforms for core services, such as DNS provision.\nPlease log in to CiSP for more information on all of these issues.

218,218,17th October 2016,"[""New Trojan used in financial attacks\nSymantec recently reported on a malware variant 'Trojan.Odinaff' which has been involved in a number of discreet campaigns targeting global financial organisations since January 2016. Organisations involved in banking, securities, trading and payroll appearto be the primary targets, with organisations providing the support services to these industries also of interest.\nAccording to the report, US institutions have been most frequently targeted, followed by Hong Kong, Australia, the UK and Ukraine. Odinaff is believed to be deployed in the first stages of an attack, as a means of gaining a foothold onto a target network. Once installed, Odinaff is capable of maintaining a stealthy, persistent presence on a network, as well as installing additional tools to assist in the attack: tools which Symantec have reported as 'bearing the hallmarks' of Carbanak, another cyber criminal group reported to have made significant financial gains through its targeting of financial organisations.\nThese Odinaff attacks are another example of high-value targeting by capable attackers seeking to maximise their financial yield per attack ratio.\nNuclear sector cyber security in focus\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Director, Yukiya Amano, informed reporters, during a recent visit to Germany, about a 'disruptive cyber attack' that took place 'two to three years ago' against an unspecified nuclear power plant.\nThere has been discussion in the cyber security blogosphere as to where this attack occurred: we judge it likely that the incident Amano referred to was the compromise and data deletion attack in late 2014 against the Korea Hydro and Nuclear Power Company (KHNP), the state-run operator of South Korea's nuclear power stations. The data affected was 'non-critical', but included blueprints, manuals and employee information. The attackers also used wiper malware to destroy data and the Master Boot Record (MBR) of a number of computers. In 2015, the South Korean Government formally accused North Korea of being behind the attack. Cyber security researchers including TrendMicro noted a number of similarities between the KHNP attack and previous incidents that have been linked to North Korea, including the 2014 Sony Pictures attack.\nThe KHNP incident received a large amount of media attention at the time, though the Korean Government stated the attack itself caused only limited disruption, and did not threaten safety systems. This event highlights the impact that even a low-level cyber attack on the nuclear sector can cause. Amano's statement draws attention to the issue ahead of an IAEA conference on wider nuclear security in December.\nVulnerabilities\nWindows and related Microsoft products dominate vulnerabilities updates this week, due to Microsoft's monthly patch Tuesday falling this week.

Over 3000 apps with embedded Trojans, including games, skins and phone optimisation tools, have been identified on sale from Android app stores, including 400 in the Google Play store alone.\nHow dresscode works\nOnce installed by an unwitting user, the malware will communicate with a command and control server, enabling attackers to issue commands in order to retrieve sensitive data. A device infected with Dresscode could also be recruited as part of a botnet, to enable subsequent DDoS or spam campaigns.\nCompromised devices can also act as proxies, relaying traffic between the attacker and networks the device is connected to. This poses risks to a user's home network and other connected devices, particularly if the home router has an easily crackable password. Researchers point out that the rise in 'Bring Your Own Device' to work policies means that corporate networks could also be at risk from Dresscode.\nReducing risks\nGoogle Play claim to have taken the necessary actions to remove Dresscode-infected apps from their store. However, there are likely to be other outlets from which users may unwittingly download this malware. Nevertheless, there are measures you can take to reduce risks, including performing regular OS updates and only downloading apps from legitimate stores and trusted publishers.\nBuild-A-Botnet\nMirai malware source code published online this week\nThe publication of this source code means less-technically capable actors are now able to quickly start building their own Internet of Things (IoT) botnets.\nThe Mirai malware was an integral component in the development of the IoT botnet, which played a part in the historically large DDoS attack against Brian Kreb’s website KrebsOnSecurity.\nSelf-propagating\nMirai malware is particularly useful for building botnets. It works by continuously scanning the internet for vulnerable IoT devices. This means anything using default or hard-coded usernames and passwords.\nThe malware seeks to brute force its way onto these devices, establish communication, and turn it into a bot. The malware is also self-propagating: once it has compromised one IoT device, it goes on to infect additional vulnerable devices to form a botnet.\nWeak passwords exploited\nInterestingly, the Mirai source code reveals the username and password combinations used to brute force IoT devices, as well as the manufacturers targeted. In total, there are just 68 username and password combinations written into the code. This is a small figure considering the huge number of IoT devices involved in the botnet which attacked the Kreb’s site.\nManufacturers have learned one important lesson from the Kreb’s DDoS incident - The use of factory set/default passwords limits the security of their devices, making them increasingly vulnerable to attack.\nThe NCSC has published an industry advisory on CiSP.

Data leaked includes names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth and encrypted passwords and is believed to be the biggest public breach of personal data ever recorded. Yahoo have stated that the attack was “state-sponsored”, although this has been contradicted by information security firm InfoArmour, who have suggested that the attack was conducted by criminals. The methods and sophistication of the attack have not yet been revealed, but it demonstrates that the frequency and scale of reported data breaches continues to grow. Furthermore as each breach of personally identifiable information creates the risk of social engineering and fraud using the stolen data and, where passwords have been reused, the potential for further data breaches.\nThe IoT botnet - the new device of choice for DDoS?\nIn the last week huge DDoS (distributed denial of service) attacks have been reported against hosting provider OVH and the Krebsonsecurity.com domain. Whilst there is an ongoing debate on the exact size of these attacks, they are indicative of the growing size of DDoS attacks over the last 12 months. In both cases, the use of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the botnet, including CCTVs and DVRs, is thought to have contributed to the scale of the attack. As the IoT continues to grow it is likely that devices will increasingly be used in DDoS botnets. IoT devices are ideally suited for conducing DDoS attacks as:\nMany use a version of the Linux operating system which is open by default and rarely patched, as a result these systems are more likely to be compromised than regularly updated systems\nIoT devices often have stripped down security systems, where security measures are not typically built in to the design and manufacture of these devices, making them a softer target for attackers\nMany IoT devices have total internet access without bandwidth limitations or filtering\nDefault and re-used passwords are systemic across IoT, due to the frequent re-use of software or hardware across several classes of device.\nA combination of these factors are likely to have contributed to the recent harnessing of IoT in successfully launching the largest reported DDoS attacks to date.\nMicrosoft to open transparency facility in Beijing\nMicrosoft is set to open a facility in Beijing to allow government IT workers to test and analyse the company’s products and services to ensure they meet security expectations. This is the third Microsoft Transparency Center after one in Belgium and the United States.\nTransparency Centres were announced in 2013 with the aim of increasing trust in Microsoft products and services amongst its community of users. The initiative came in the wake of the Snowdon revelations and aims to allay fears about backdoors in major hardware and software products. The Chinese government had previously mandated that foreign software vendors selling to Chinese banks had to reveal source code and submit to rigorous software audits, however it has subsequently stepped away from this requirement. The centre is not without precedent as IBM allegedly allowed Beijing auditors to review source code in late 2015. The emphasis on transparency highlights the cyber security industry’s concern regarding backdoors and the Centre may herald a new norm where transparency becomes a requirement to conducting business.\nVulnerabilities\nThe OpenSSL Project\nThe OpenSSL project has released patches for fourteen vulnerabilities, one of which is critical (CVE-2016-6304) and could be exploited to launch a denial of service (DoS) attack. CVE-2016-6304 impacts the Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) verification process, and could be exploited in order to trigger a memory exhaustion attack resulting in a denial of service. A fix included in the updates introduced a critical vulnerability that could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution. OpenSSL have provided an advisory which can be found here. It states “The patch applied to address CVE-2016-6307 resulted in an issue where if a message larger than approx 16k is received then the underlying buffer to store the incoming message is reallocated and moved. Unfortunately a dangling pointer to the old location is left which results in an attempt to write to the previously freed location”.
